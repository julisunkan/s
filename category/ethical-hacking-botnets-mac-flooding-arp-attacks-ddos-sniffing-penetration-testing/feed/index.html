<p><strong>Social-Engineering Toolkit</strong></p>



<p>Social Engineering is an important technique that you should be aware of, and shortly you will understand how hackers use social engineering applications tricking victims into executing the vulnerable trap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbrd4k
</div><figcaption>Social Engineering Toolkits</figcaption></figure>



<p>SET or Social-Engineering Toolkit is an open source Python-driven framework that???s specifically designed to facilitate social engineering attacks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxhcik
</div><figcaption>Social Engineering Toolkit (2)</figcaption></figure>



<p>A significant advantage of the Social-Engineering Toolkit is its inter-connectivity with the Metasploit framework which provides the payloads needed for exploitation, the encryption to bypass antivirus, and the listener module that connects to the compromised system when it sends a shell back to the attacker.</p>



<p>To start the Social-Engineering Toolkit, type the command</p>



<p>???setoolkit???</p>



<p>and press Enter. You have multiple options to select from when this application loads. The first one is the Social-Engineering Attacks, which offers a mix of Social-Engineering methods.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x51kqri
</div><figcaption>SET Attacks Vector</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second one is the Fast-Track Penetration Testing, which provides rapid access to some specialized tools. You can type number 2 to select this option.</p>



<p>Next, you will be presented further options. The first tool is a password cracking of SQL databases, the second are some customized exploits that are based on Python.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5zmhlj
</div><figcaption>Install SET on Android</figcaption></figure>



<p>After that, we have the User Enumeration, and finally it contains the PSEXEC Powershell Injection. You can type number 99 to go back to the main menu, but if you select the first choice which contains tools for Social-Engineering Attacks, all you have to do is press number 1 on your keyboard.</p>



<p>Once you have selected this option, once again you will have further options. The first one on the list is the Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors which allows an attacker to create email messages and send them to targeted victims with attached exploits.</p>



<p>Next, we have the website Attack Vectors which utilize multiple web-based attacks. If you select that to see the details, simply press number 2 on your keyboard.</p>



<p><a></a>Once you have selected this option, you will be presented with further options once again. The first on the list called Java Applet Attack Method that spoofs a Java certificate and delivers a Metasploit-based payload.</p>



<p>This is known as one of the most successful attacks, and it is effective against all systems such as Windows, Linux or OSX targets. Next on the list is called the Metasploit Browser Exploit Method that delivers a Metasploit payload using an I-frame attack.</p>



<p>Next on the list we have what it???s called the Credential Harvester attack method that clones a website and automatically rewrites the post-parameters to allow an attacker to intercept and harvest user credentials.</p>



<p>Next on our list we have what is called the Tabnabbing Attack Method which replaces information on an inactive browser tab with a cloned page that links back to the attacker.</p>



<p>After that we have the Web Jacking Attack Method which utilizes I-frame replacements to make the highlighted URL link appear legitimate. Last on the list we have the Multi-Attack web Method that allows an attacker to select some or several, or all attacks that can be launched at once.</p>



<p>If you go back to the previous screen and check the rest of the attacks listed, the Infectious Media Generator for example creates an auto-run file and Metasploit payload.</p>



<p>Once this copied to a USB device and inserted into target system, it will trigger and auto-run and compromise the system. Next, it will create a Payload and Listener module which is a rapid menu-driven method, creating a Metasploit payload.</p>



<p>After that, we have what is called the Mass Mailer Attack which allows the attacker to send multiple customized emails to a single email address, or a list of multiple addresses.</p>



<p>Next, we have the Arduino-Based Attack Vector which programs Arduino-based devices. Because these devices register as a USB keyboard when connected to a physical Windows system, they can bypass security based on disabling the auto-run or other endpoint security.</p>



<p>The Wireless Access Point Attack Vector for example will create a fake wireless access point and DHCP server on the attacker&#8217;s system and redirect</p>



<p>all DNS queries to the attacker.</p>



<p>The hacker can then launch various attacks, such as the Java Applet Attack or a Credential Harvester Attack. The QRCode Generator Attack Vector for example creates a QR code with a defined URL associated with an attack.</p>



<p>The Powershell Attack Vectors will allow the attacker to create attacks that rely on Powershell, a command-line shell and scripting language available on all systems such as Windows, Vista, and higher versions.</p>



<p>Lastly, we have Third Party Modules that allow the attacker to use the remote administration tool as part of a Java Applet Attack, or as an isolated payload.</p>



<p>This tool is a text, menu-driven, remote access tool. Covering all these methods would take another book by itself, but as you see SET is very user friendly and pretty much anyone can use it because all you have to do is decide which attack you want to implement, then press their associated number on your keyboard.</p>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using SET in a live or production environment. If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

<p>A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources. Computer networks are the basis of communication in IT. They are used in a huge variety of ways and can include many different types of network. A computer network is a set of computers that are connected together so that they can share information. The earliest examples of computer networks are from the 1960s, but they have come a long way in the half-century since then.</p>

<li><strong>Open system</strong>: an open system is connected to the network and prepared for communication.</li>



<li><strong>Closed system</strong>: a closed system is not connected to the network and so can???t be communicated with.</li>



<li><strong>Port</strong>: a port is a channel through which data is sent and received.</li>



<li><strong>Nodes</strong>: nodes is a term used to refer to any computing devices such as computers that send and receive network packets across the network.</li>



<li><strong>Network packets</strong>: the data that is sent to and from the nodes in a network.</li>



<li><strong>Routers</strong>: routers are pieces of hardware that manage router packets. They determine which node the information came from and where to send it to. A router has a routing protocol which defines how it communicates with other routers.</li>



<li><strong>???Network address translation (NAT)</strong>: a technique that routers use to provide internet service to more devices using fewer public IPs. A router has a public IP address but devices connected to it are assigned private IPs that others outside of the network can???t see.</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)</strong>: assigns dynamic IP addresses to hosts and is maintained by the internet service provider.</li>

</code></pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-arithmetic-behind-ipv4">The arithmetic behind IPv4:<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/0-Networking-101.html#the-arithmetic-behind-ipv4"></a></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One octet have 8 bits:</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 2^0. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7. So if all binary bits are a one, the decimal equivalent would be 255 as shown here:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>  1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
(128 +64 +32 +16 +8  +4  +2  +1) --&gt; 255 

Example of octet conversion:
IP Address: 192.168.64.3

To calculate the first octet (192.), from binary format to decimal:

128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1         
 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 1   1   0   0   0   0   0   0          
 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
128+ 64+ 0+  0+  0+  0+  0+  0 = 192   ---&gt; final value (firt octet IPv4 in decimal)

</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take the IP:&nbsp;<code>192.168.64.3</code></li>



<li>The first octet&nbsp;<code>192</code>&nbsp;in 8-bit binary is&nbsp;<code>11000000</code>.</li>



<li>Only the&nbsp;<code>8th</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>7th</code>&nbsp;bit is on and the rest of them (<code>6th to 1st bit</code>) is off, meaning the decimal value is the final sum of these values:&nbsp;<code>128 + 64 = 192</code></li>
</ul>



<p>??????&nbsp;<strong>Why? Computers see everything in terms of binaryll; on and off.</strong></p>

<p>All IPv4 addresses can be divided into two major groups:&nbsp;<strong>global (or public, external)</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; this group can also be called ???WAN addresses??? ??? those that are used on the Internet, and&nbsp;<strong>private (or local, internal) addresses</strong>&nbsp;??? those that are used in the local network (LAN).</p>

<p>Private (internal) addresses are not routed on the Internet and no traffic can be sent to them from the Internet, they only supposed to work within the local network. Private addresses include IP addresses from the following subnets:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/02a533c1d55ca0ba83e0176168df06ec/tumblr_inline_o4m1taQugo1u4ytoo_1280.jpg" alt="private-ip"/></figure>

<p>NAT stands for network address translation. It???s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8275f73b57bdcb982b1d69aa8d213d2bdb384657/nat2.png" alt="nat2"/></figure>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-subnetting">Why subnetting?<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/0-Networking-101.html#why-subnetting"></a></h3>



<p>The way IP addresses are constructed makes it relatively simple for Internet routers to find the right network to route data into. However, in a Class A network (for instance), there could be millions of connected devices, and it could take some time for the data to find the right device. This is why subnetting comes in handy: subnetting narrows down the IP address to usage within a range of devices.</p>



<p>Because an IP address is limited to indicating the network and the device address, IP addresses cannot be used to indicate which subnet an IP packet should go to. Routers within a network use something called a subnet mask to sort data into subnetworks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>?????? Subnetting is really important for penetration testers and aspiring hackers, eventually you will face several cases involving small or large networks in your future engagements. Understanding the IP address type, range, available hosts is crucial for any network analysis.</p>

<li>What is TCP used for?</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What does TCP mean?</li>
</ul>



<p>TCP means Transmission Control Protocol, which is a communications standard for delivering data and messages through networks. TCP is a basic standard that defines the rules of the internet and is a common protocol used to deliver data in digital network communications.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The TCP/IP model consists of several types of protocols, including:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>TCP and IP</li>



<li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</li>



<li>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</li>



<li>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)</li>

<p><sub><sup>TCP/IP Model</sup></sub></p>



<p>TCP is the most commonly used of these protocols and accounts for the most traffic used on a TCP/IP network.&nbsp;<strong>UDP is an alternative to TCP that does not provide error correction, is less reliable, and has less overhead, which makes it ideal for streaming.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-user-datagram-protocol-udp">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP)<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/0-Networking-101.html#the-user-datagram-protocol-udp"></a></h2>



<p>Is a lightweight data transport protocol that works on top of IP. UDP provides a mechanism to detect corrupt data in packets, but it does not attempt to solve other problems that arise with packets, such as lost or out of order packets. That???s why UDP is sometimes known as the Unreliable Data Protocol. UDP is simple but fast, at least in comparison to other protocols that work over IP. It???s often used for time-sensitive applications (such as real-time video streaming) where speed is more important than accuracy.</p>

<p>TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection. The connection is full duplex, and both sides synchronize (SYN) and acknowledge (ACK) each other. The exchange of these four flags is performed in three steps:</p>

<p><strong>ARP Poisoning with EtterCAP</strong></p>



<p>Imagine that you have been assigned to carry out a MITM (Man in the Middle) attack against a specific host or server, and the choice of tools to use are up to you.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to carry out a MITM attack , and in this chapter we are going to use another excellent tool that you might consider called EtterCAP.</p>



<p>EtterCAP is another great way of going about MITM attack as it has user friendly Graphical User Interface or GUI that provides a so called click, select and go method.</p>



<p>It???s always better to have more knowledge on additional tools if they wouldn???t work or wouldn???t have access at the time of yo uare assigned to do pen testing.</p>



<p>You should be aware that in order to achieve the same result, there are other options that you can go for. EtterCAP is another built in tool on Kali Linux platform. To launch EtterCAP, you can issue a command:</p>



<p>???ettercap ???G???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Once EtterCAP is launched, it will wait for us to provide further instructions, and you should first click on a menu option: Sniff &gt; then choose ???unified sniffing???.</p>



<p>Next, you should specify the network interface that you will use for sniffing. In my case it???s ethernet0.</p>



<p>This will create some additional menu options, so now you should click on the menu option: ???Host???, then click on ???Scan for hosts???.</p>



<p>This should take no longer 5 seconds to discover all hosts that are on the same network. Once complete, go back to the menu icon; Host &gt; then click on host lists in order to see all the hosts IP Addresses and the MAC addresses associated to them.</p>



<p>Once ou have a list of hosts, you can highlight the source address and click on ???<em>Add to target 1???</em>, then highlight the destination address and click on ???<em>Add</em> <em>to target 2???.</em></p>



<p><a></a>The method we use is called ARP POISONING.</p>



<p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Routers, Layer 3 Switches have ARP entries or ARP tables that contains all IP Addresses and their associated Mac Addresses or Physical Addresses that are connected to the network.</p>



<p>Yet, if we use ARP Poisoning, we could fake the real source address by telling the destination that we have the IP Address and the Mac address of the source node, so all traffic that is planned to reach the real source host, from now on, would first come to us.</p>



<p>In addition, all traffic that is planned to reach the destination host would come to us as well, as we would also poison the real source and tell it that the destination IP Address and Mac address is now our machine.</p>



<p>Using ARP Poisoning is one of the best method to create a Man in the Middle attack as now all traffic that is going back and forth between the source and the destination is actully coming through us.</p>



<p>Having all those traffic captured, we can decide if we just want to analyse it, other then capture it, modify it, forward to a different destination, or simple stop the communication between those devices.</p>



<p>Therefore, the final piece to launch such an attack is to click on the menu icon called ???MITM??? and then select ???ARP poisoning???. Once you finished and want to stop ARP Poisoning, click on ???Stop MITM attack(s)???.</p>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using this method in a live or production environment, as any type of Man in the Middle attack is very dangerous, especially when you manipulate routed traffic through poisoning the ARP tables by feeding fake Mac addresses.</p>



<p>If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

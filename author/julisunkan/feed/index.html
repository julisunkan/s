<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="requirements">Requirements<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/1-Lab-Building.html#requirements"></a></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Windows 10, macOS or any Linux distro
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>At least 8 GB RAM (16GB recommended)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="objectives">Objectives<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/1-Lab-Building.html#objectives"></a></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Understand how virtual machines work</li>



<li>Learn how to create a basic virtual environment for pentesting purpose</li>
</ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-does-virtual-machine-vm-means">What does Virtual Machine (VM) means?</h1>



<p>For simplicity, think of a virtual machine (VM) as a ???computer made of software??? which you can use to run any software you???d run on a real, physical computer. Like a physical machine, a virtual machine has its own operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.), storage, networking, configuration settings, and software, and it is fully isolated from other virtual machines running on that host.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="937" height="685" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg" alt="vm" class="wp-image-8754" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg 937w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-300x219.jpeg 300w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-768x561.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Security benefits</strong>&nbsp;??? Because virtual machines run in multiple operating systems, using a guest operating system on a VM allows you to run apps of questionable security and protects your host operating system. VMs also allow for better security forensics, pentesting and are often used to safely study computer viruses, isolating the viruses to avoid risking their host computer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hypervisors">Hypervisors<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/1-Lab-Building.html#hypervisors"></a></h3>



<p>There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as&nbsp;<strong>???Type 1??? (or ???bare metal???)</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>???Type 2??? (or ???hosted???)</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="598" height="287" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.png" alt="hypervisors" class="wp-image-8755" srcset="../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.png 598w, ../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Type 1</strong>??hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host???s hardware.</li>



<li><strong>Type 2</strong>??hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.</li>
</ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-virtualbox-installation">1. VirtualBox Installation</h1>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>This tutorial use??<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VM VirtualBox</a>, the most popular free and open-source hosted hypervisor for x86 virtualization, developed by Oracle.</strong></li>



<li>There are other options from different vendors to achieve the same result:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html">VMware Player for Windows (30 day trial)</a></li>



<li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMware Fusion for macOS (30 day trial)</a></li>



<li><a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/">Windows Hyper-V</a></li>



<li><a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation">Linux KVM</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Make sure your PC support hardware virtualization (Windows)</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reboot your computer</li>



<li>Right when the computer is coming up from the black screen, press Delete, Esc, F1, F2, or F4. Each computer manufacturer uses a different key but it may show a brief message at boot telling you which one to press. If you miss it the first time, reboot and try again. It helps to tap the key about twice a second when the computer is coming up. If you are not able to enter the BIOS via this method, consult your computer???s manual.</li>



<li>In the BIOS settings, find the configuration items related to the CPU. These can be in under the headings Processor, Chipset, or Northbridge.</li>



<li>Enable virtualization; the setting may be called??<strong>VT-x, AMD-V, SVM, or Vanderpool</strong>. Enable Intel VT-d or AMD IOMMU if the options are available.</li>



<li>Save your changes and reboot.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Social-Engineering Toolkit</strong></p>



<p>Social Engineering is an important technique that you should be aware of, and shortly you will understand how hackers use social engineering applications tricking victims into executing the vulnerable trap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbrd4k
</div><figcaption>Social Engineering Toolkits</figcaption></figure>



<p>SET or Social-Engineering Toolkit is an open source Python-driven framework that???s specifically designed to facilitate social engineering attacks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxhcik
</div><figcaption>Social Engineering Toolkit (2)</figcaption></figure>



<p>A significant advantage of the Social-Engineering Toolkit is its inter-connectivity with the Metasploit framework which provides the payloads needed for exploitation, the encryption to bypass antivirus, and the listener module that connects to the compromised system when it sends a shell back to the attacker.</p>



<p>To start the Social-Engineering Toolkit, type the command</p>



<p>???setoolkit???</p>



<p>and press Enter. You have multiple options to select from when this application loads. The first one is the Social-Engineering Attacks, which offers a mix of Social-Engineering methods.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x51kqri
</div><figcaption>SET Attacks Vector</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second one is the Fast-Track Penetration Testing, which provides rapid access to some specialized tools. You can type number 2 to select this option.</p>



<p>Next, you will be presented further options. The first tool is a password cracking of SQL databases, the second are some customized exploits that are based on Python.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5zmhlj
</div><figcaption>Install SET on Android</figcaption></figure>



<p>After that, we have the User Enumeration, and finally it contains the PSEXEC Powershell Injection. You can type number 99 to go back to the main menu, but if you select the first choice which contains tools for Social-Engineering Attacks, all you have to do is press number 1 on your keyboard.</p>



<p>Once you have selected this option, once again you will have further options. The first one on the list is the Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors which allows an attacker to create email messages and send them to targeted victims with attached exploits.</p>



<p>Next, we have the website Attack Vectors which utilize multiple web-based attacks. If you select that to see the details, simply press number 2 on your keyboard.</p>



<p><a></a>Once you have selected this option, you will be presented with further options once again. The first on the list called Java Applet Attack Method that spoofs a Java certificate and delivers a Metasploit-based payload.</p>



<p>This is known as one of the most successful attacks, and it is effective against all systems such as Windows, Linux or OSX targets. Next on the list is called the Metasploit Browser Exploit Method that delivers a Metasploit payload using an I-frame attack.</p>



<p>Next on the list we have what it???s called the Credential Harvester attack method that clones a website and automatically rewrites the post-parameters to allow an attacker to intercept and harvest user credentials.</p>



<p>Next on our list we have what is called the Tabnabbing Attack Method which replaces information on an inactive browser tab with a cloned page that links back to the attacker.</p>



<p>After that we have the Web Jacking Attack Method which utilizes I-frame replacements to make the highlighted URL link appear legitimate. Last on the list we have the Multi-Attack web Method that allows an attacker to select some or several, or all attacks that can be launched at once.</p>



<p>If you go back to the previous screen and check the rest of the attacks listed, the Infectious Media Generator for example creates an auto-run file and Metasploit payload.</p>



<p>Once this copied to a USB device and inserted into target system, it will trigger and auto-run and compromise the system. Next, it will create a Payload and Listener module which is a rapid menu-driven method, creating a Metasploit payload.</p>



<p>After that, we have what is called the Mass Mailer Attack which allows the attacker to send multiple customized emails to a single email address, or a list of multiple addresses.</p>



<p>Next, we have the Arduino-Based Attack Vector which programs Arduino-based devices. Because these devices register as a USB keyboard when connected to a physical Windows system, they can bypass security based on disabling the auto-run or other endpoint security.</p>



<p>The Wireless Access Point Attack Vector for example will create a fake wireless access point and DHCP server on the attacker&#8217;s system and redirect</p>



<p>all DNS queries to the attacker.</p>



<p>The hacker can then launch various attacks, such as the Java Applet Attack or a Credential Harvester Attack. The QRCode Generator Attack Vector for example creates a QR code with a defined URL associated with an attack.</p>



<p>The Powershell Attack Vectors will allow the attacker to create attacks that rely on Powershell, a command-line shell and scripting language available on all systems such as Windows, Vista, and higher versions.</p>



<p>Lastly, we have Third Party Modules that allow the attacker to use the remote administration tool as part of a Java Applet Attack, or as an isolated payload.</p>



<p>This tool is a text, menu-driven, remote access tool. Covering all these methods would take another book by itself, but as you see SET is very user friendly and pretty much anyone can use it because all you have to do is decide which attack you want to implement, then press their associated number on your keyboard.</p>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using SET in a live or production environment. If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

<p>A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources. Computer networks are the basis of communication in IT. They are used in a huge variety of ways and can include many different types of network. A computer network is a set of computers that are connected together so that they can share information. The earliest examples of computer networks are from the 1960s, but they have come a long way in the half-century since then.</p>

<li><strong>Port</strong>: a port is a channel through which data is sent and received.</li>



<li><strong>Nodes</strong>: nodes is a term used to refer to any computing devices such as computers that send and receive network packets across the network.</li>



<li><strong>Network packets</strong>: the data that is sent to and from the nodes in a network.</li>



<li><strong>Routers</strong>: routers are pieces of hardware that manage router packets. They determine which node the information came from and where to send it to. A router has a routing protocol which defines how it communicates with other routers.</li>

<p>Here is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 2^0. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7. So if all binary bits are a one, the decimal equivalent would be 255 as shown here:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>  1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
(128 +64 +32 +16 +8  +4  +2  +1) --&gt; 255 

Example of octet conversion:
IP Address: 192.168.64.3

To calculate the first octet (192.), from binary format to decimal:

128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1         
 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 1   1   0   0   0   0   0   0          
 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
128+ 64+ 0+  0+  0+  0+  0+  0 = 192   ---&gt; final value (firt octet IPv4 in decimal)

</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take the IP:&nbsp;<code>192.168.64.3</code></li>



<li>The first octet&nbsp;<code>192</code>&nbsp;in 8-bit binary is&nbsp;<code>11000000</code>.</li>



<li>Only the&nbsp;<code>8th</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>7th</code>&nbsp;bit is on and the rest of them (<code>6th to 1st bit</code>) is off, meaning the decimal value is the final sum of these values:&nbsp;<code>128 + 64 = 192</code></li>
</ul>

<p>All IPv4 addresses can be divided into two major groups:&nbsp;<strong>global (or public, external)</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; this group can also be called ???WAN addresses??? ??? those that are used on the Internet, and&nbsp;<strong>private (or local, internal) addresses</strong>&nbsp;??? those that are used in the local network (LAN).</p>

<p>Private (internal) addresses are not routed on the Internet and no traffic can be sent to them from the Internet, they only supposed to work within the local network. Private addresses include IP addresses from the following subnets:</p>

<p>NAT stands for network address translation. It???s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8275f73b57bdcb982b1d69aa8d213d2bdb384657/nat2.png" alt="nat2"/></figure>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Static NAT</strong>When the local address is converted to a public one, this NAT chooses the same one. This means there will be a consistent public IP address associated with that router or NAT device.</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic NAT</strong>Instead of choosing the same IP address every time, this NAT goes through a pool of public IP addresses. This results in the router or NAT device getting a different address each time the router translates the local address to a public address.</li>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-subnetting">3. Subnetting</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-subnetting">Why subnetting?<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/0-Networking-101.html#why-subnetting"></a></h3>



<p>The way IP addresses are constructed makes it relatively simple for Internet routers to find the right network to route data into. However, in a Class A network (for instance), there could be millions of connected devices, and it could take some time for the data to find the right device. This is why subnetting comes in handy: subnetting narrows down the IP address to usage within a range of devices.</p>



<p>Because an IP address is limited to indicating the network and the device address, IP addresses cannot be used to indicate which subnet an IP packet should go to. Routers within a network use something called a subnet mask to sort data into subnetworks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>?????? Subnetting is really important for penetration testers and aspiring hackers, eventually you will face several cases involving small or large networks in your future engagements. Understanding the IP address type, range, available hosts is crucial for any network analysis.</p>

<p>The first three bytes of a MAC address were originally known as&nbsp;<strong>OUI???s, or Organizational Unique Identifiers. Each manufacturer of networking equipment was assigned an OUI, and was free to assign their own numbers in that block.</strong></p>

<li>What is TCP used for?</li>
</ul>



<p>TCP enables data to be transferred between applications and devices on a network. It is designed to break down a message, such as an email, into packets of data to ensure the message reaches its destination successfully and as quickly as possible.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What does TCP mean?</li>
</ul>



<p>TCP means Transmission Control Protocol, which is a communications standard for delivering data and messages through networks. TCP is a basic standard that defines the rules of the internet and is a common protocol used to deliver data in digital network communications.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The TCP/IP model consists of several types of protocols, including:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>TCP and IP</li>



<li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</li>



<li>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</li>



<li>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)</li>



<li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</li>
</ul>

<p><sub><sup>TCP/IP Model</sup></sub></p>



<p>TCP is the most commonly used of these protocols and accounts for the most traffic used on a TCP/IP network.&nbsp;<strong>UDP is an alternative to TCP that does not provide error correction, is less reliable, and has less overhead, which makes it ideal for streaming.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-user-datagram-protocol-udp">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP)<a href="http://julisunkan.github.io/Network-Servers-Penetration-Guides-and-Tools/0-Core-Knowledge/0-Networking-101.html#the-user-datagram-protocol-udp"></a></h2>



<p>Is a lightweight data transport protocol that works on top of IP. UDP provides a mechanism to detect corrupt data in packets, but it does not attempt to solve other problems that arise with packets, such as lost or out of order packets. That???s why UDP is sometimes known as the Unreliable Data Protocol. UDP is simple but fast, at least in comparison to other protocols that work over IP. It???s often used for time-sensitive applications (such as real-time video streaming) where speed is more important than accuracy.</p>

<p>TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection. The connection is full duplex, and both sides synchronize (SYN) and acknowledge (ACK) each other. The exchange of these four flags is performed in three steps:</p>

<p><strong>Armitage Hail Mary</strong></p>



<p>Armitage is an excellent GUI frontend for the Metasploit framework. Armitage was developed with the goal of helping security professionals better understanding hackers and how they deploy various attacks.</p>



<p>For further information about this excellent project, please check the Armitage official website at fastandeasyhacking.com. How to use Armitage?</p>



<p>Well, Armitage is also included in Kali Linux, hence all you have to do is to turn it on is type within your command line interface:</p>



<p>???armitage???</p>



<p>Then press enter. You can just accept the default options for the window it pops up the first time, and click on the Connect button, then click Yes to start the Metasploit RPC server.</p>



<p>The Armitage user interface has three main panels called Modules, Targets, and Tabs. You can click the area between those panels to resize them if you wish, but let???s look at each of these panels.</p>



<p>The module browser panel allows you to launch a Metasploit auxillary module, an exploit, or generate a payload and run a post-exploitation module.</p>



<p>The target panel shows your targets. Armitage represents each target as a computer with its assigned or static IP address and other information about it below the computer icon.</p>



<p>Once you run the Armitage tool, it should already identify one hosts if you have other systems running in your session. If you have many hosts, the graph view will become difficult to work with.</p>



<p>If this happens, for this situation, Armitage has a table view instead. Therefore, go to Armitage menu item, then select the ???Set Target View???, and then select the ???Table View??? option. Down below, you have the tabs area.</p>



<p>Armitage opens each dialog console and table in a tab below the module and target panels. Metasploit console or Meterpreter console and shell interfaces are each use a console tab.</p>



<p>A console tab allows you to interact with those interfaces through Armitage. If you want to open a new console, you have to go to the View menu and select Console.</p>



<p><a></a>Armitage logs are all console shell and the event-log will gives you an output for you. It organizes those logs by date and nodes. You will find these logs in the Armitage folder.</p>



<p>Go to View, then Reporting, select then the ???Activity Logs??? to open the folder. Imagine that you want to export all traffic you have done in this application.</p>



<p>Armitage and Metasploit share a database to track your hosts, services, vulnerabilities, credentials, and user agent strings, captured by browser exploit modules.</p>



<p>To get all this information, go to View, Reporting, and then click on Export Data. This option will export the data from Metasploit and create easily parsable XML tab separated value files.</p>



<p>When it comes to workspaces, Armitage Dynamic Workspaces feature allows you to create views into the host database and quickly switch between them.</p>



<p>To better understand what I&#8217;m talking about, select the Workspaces menu, and then click on Manage. To manage your dynamic workspaces, you may add, edit, and remove workspaces you already created.</p>



<p>To start an attack, Armitage bundles several Metasploit scans into one feature called MSF Scans. This feature will scan for a handful of open ports.</p>



<p>Similarly to nmap, it then enumerates several common services using Metasploit auxillary modules which are built in for the purpose. For your example, you can be attacking a Windows XP machine.</p>



<p>You can select it, right click, and then click on Scan. You may also go to Hosts menu, and click on MSF Scans, as they both will give you the same functionality.</p>



<p>After the scan is complete, before you go and start attacking, you must choose your weapon. Armitage makes this process very easy. Select the ???Attacks??? menu and click on Find Attacks.</p>



<p>The ???Find Attacks??? option will generate a custom attack menu for each host. To exploit a host, right click on it and navigate to Attack, and choose an ???Exploit??? from the list.</p>



<p>The ???Exploit??? dialog allows you configure options for a module and choose whether to use a reverse connect payload or not. For remote exploits,</p>



<p><a></a>Armitage chooses your payload for you.</p>



<p>Generally, Armitage will use Meterpreter for Windows targets, and a command shell payload for UNIX targets. After this, all you have to do is to click on the ???Launch??? button.</p>



<p>If the exploit is successful, Armitage will make the host red and surround it with spooky lightning balls. If manual exploitation fails, don&#8217;t worry. You have the ???Hail Mary??? option.</p>



<p>Go to the ???Attacks??? menu and click on the ???Hail Mary??? to launch this feature. Armitage???s Hail Mary feature will find exploits relevant to your target, then filters the exploits using known information, and then sorts them into an optimal order.</p>



<p>This feature won&#8217;t find every possible shell, but it&#8217;s a good option if you don&#8217;t know what else to try. Armitage makes it easy to manage the Meterpreter agent once you successfully exploit a host.</p>



<p>Next, you can right-click on the ???host??? to access the Meterpreter menu, then select ???Meterpreter??? and choose whatever you like from the list.</p>



<p>For example, you can select the ???browse files from the list???. Do not be surprised if it finds directory items on the victim&#8217;s machine. Armitage is great and very easy to use, but I recommend you to practice with it and see which attack method is most successful to your requirements.</p>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using Armitage in a live or production environment. If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Brute Force Attack with TCP Hydra</strong></p>



<p>I will teach you how to analyse a brute force attack against the target system. In this scenario imagine that you have 3 nodes. The attacker is going to use a Kali Linux with the IP address of 10.0.0.111, and the victim machine will be using a Windows 10 device with an IP address of 10.0.0.202.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="gpu brute force attack wpa2 handshake crack" frameborder="0" width="768" height="431" src="https://geo.dailymotion.com/player.html?video=xzo1jo&#038;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">GPU Brute Force Attack</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, the penetration tester will use Kali Linux to intercept all the traffic and analyse any attacks on the network. Imagine that you are the attacker and you want to attack one of the hosts on the network that has a Telnet service turned on.</p>



<p>The first thing a hacker is going to do is to try to brute force the target victim. To begin with a brute-force attack, there are various tools that you can use, but there is one which is very popular amongst pen testers and we haven???t covered yet is called ???hydra???.</p>



<p>To use hydra, you have to first open your Klai Linux terminal window, and type the command:</p>



<p>???hydra ???V ???l (dictionary password file path) ???t 50 ???(victim IP address) ssh???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Here, the ???-V??? option is for maximum verbosity, then the ???-l??? is for the log in name, followed by the dictionary password file path, and the ??????t??? argument selects the number of parallel connections.</p>



<p>The greater the number, the faster the testing will occur, followed by the victim IP address, and finally, the protocol that I want to brute force. Once you have pressed Enter, the attack will begin, and all you have to do is now wait for the password to be cracked.</p>



<p>The password should be cracked in few minutes. From a hacker perspective, what is the next step? Well, the hacker will try to log in using Telnet.</p>



<p>First, the hacker would issue the Telnet command, then specify the IP address of the victim&#8217;s host, and enter the login name followed by the cracked password.</p>



<p>At this moment, the hacker is happy about this victory. If you jump into the penetration tester machine and analyse this hack, you should see what happens when the attacker tries a combination of username and passwords that are not authorized.</p>



<p><a></a>To analyse these types of conversations in Wireshark, right click on any packet and select ???Follow TCP Stream???. The message will say that no more connections are allowed to telnet server. ???Please try again later???.</p>



<p>This is the typical message that the attacker is receiving over and over again when he fails during the brute-force attack.</p>



<p>Within Wireshark when you look at the tapped traffic, you have to scroll down until you don???t see this type of pattern anymore, and if follow the stream again, you should see the username and password in plain text, and you should also see the command that the attacker executed.</p>



<p>The list that you see in this page is Clear Text Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Email protocols such as POP, IMAP, SMTP, Telnet or Voice over IP.</p>



<p>If you find that your client is using one of these protocols, you need to mention that in your final report. A simple solution is to replace these clear-text protocols with other secured protocols such as HTTPS instead of HTTP, SFTP, or SCP instead of FTP and so on.</p>

<p><strong>DoS Attack with MKD3</strong></p>



<p>Another enterprise security threat is of course the DOS or Denial of service attacks. As the name suggests, a denial of service attack, if successful, prevents other people using the resource or services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>DOS Attacks On Wireless Networks</figcaption></figure>



<p>It disrupts the services for other users. There was a case in the press where an individual had decided that he was tired of people using their cell phone while driving so he drove around with a cellular jammer in his car and as he was driving around he was jamming all the frequencies on the cellular network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>Dos Attacks on The Deep Web Kali Linux</figcaption></figure>



<p>So vehicles around him, those people can&#8217;t use their cell phones and you might say, wow that&#8217;s a great idea, but you have to remember that law enforcement, ambulances, also use the cellular services.</p>



<p>Therefore when you disrupt frequencies on cellular network for other people, you&#8217;re also disrupting it for services that you don&#8217;t want to be disrupting it for. This particular individual was tracked down eventually, and once they found him, and he got arrested, and he got heavily fined.</p>



<p>But, how do you execute a denial of service attack? Well, In wireless there are two major ways. The first is to bombard your Wi-Fi access point with useless traffic. If you create a lot of traffic and the access point is trying to decide what to do with that, does it process all those authentication request?</p>



<p>What if you sent a probe request, and while the access point is dealing with that traffic, it&#8217;s not dealing with other user traffic. So basically, one approach is just to occupy the access point so it then can&#8217;t handle legitimate traffic.</p>



<p>The second approach is simply to create noise and interference in the frequency band that the access point is operating on. I can broadcast signals that just disrupt and interfere with any other signals that are going over the air at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrlf29
</div><figcaption>How To Perform a Dos Attacks</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, in this chapter, I&#8217;m going to share with you how to perform a DOS attack. Denial of service or DOS means that we are going to kicking everybody off of a network and denying them service.</p>



<p>First, we need to attach our wireless network adapter. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you need to open up a terminal and then type;</p>



<p><a></a>???ifconfig???</p>



<p>press enter and now you need to open up a text file because you need to make note of some information. First, we&#8217;re going to make note of our wireless interface which for me is wlan0.</p>



<p>Go ahead and make note of that name. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you can clear your terminal by typing</p>



<p>???clear???</p>



<p>then press Enter. Next, we need to scan available access points so we can find a target, so type;</p>



<p>???iwlist wlan0 scan???</p>



<p>then press Enter. This will list all the available access points, so go ahead and search for a target. Once you&#8217;ve found your target, you need to make note of the e SSID and then you need to make note of the BSSID, and then you need to make note of the channel number.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that, we need to create a blacklist file so type;</p>



<p>???echo (target access point???s BSSID) &gt; blacklist???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. This will create a file called ???blacklist???, containing the target access points BSSID. Now we need to put our wireless interface into monitor mode. To do that type;</p>



<p>???airmon-ng start wlan0???</p>



<p>then press Enter. This command will create a monitor interface called ???mon0??? Go ahead and make note of that monitor interface. To confirm that is your monitoring interface is called, you can type;</p>



<p>???airmon-ng???</p>



<p>And then press ENTER. This will display all of your interfaces, and you should see there the new monitoring interface called ???mon0???. Now we are ready to perform our DOS attack, so let&#8217;s go ahead and type;</p>



<p>???mdk3???</p>



<p>then press enter. Next, we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???mdk3 mon0 d ???b blacklist ???c 6???</p>



<p><a></a>Here, you have to type the monitor interface name which is mon0, then the name of our blacklist file which in my case is called ???blacklist???, and then the channel of our target access point which is in my case is ???6???.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that go ahead and press ENTER. Next, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s going to begin sending packets and it&#8217;s going to start to flood the network.</p>



<p>In the meanwhile if you going to look other machines connected to the same network, you&#8217;ll notice that those will be disconnected. Now we need to go ahead and open up another terminal, and we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???mdk3 mon0 a ???m ???i (target access points BSSID)???</p>



<p>and press Enter. From looking at another computer nearby, you should see that it&#8217;s just been kicked off the network. If you look at your Wi-Fi, you should see that it???s been disconnected.</p>



<p>You can go ahead and try to connect to the targeted BSSID, but it&#8217;s going to give you a connection timeout message. That???s it. As you see DOS attacks are relatively simple. You should see that you have been disconnected and now we can no longer connect and that&#8217;s how you can perform a DOS attack using MDK3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p><strong>Evil Twin Deauthentication Attack with mdk3</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to teach you how to create an evil twin access point on a Kali Linux virtual machine. In addition, I&#8217;m going to show you how to use the evil twin access point in combination with some social engineering techniques to obtain a targets WPA or WPA2 password.</p>



<p>To complete this attack, you will need to have a USB network adapter that supports monitor mode. If you don&#8217;t already have a USB network adapter the supports monitor mode, I already recommended network adapters in some of the previous chapters.</p>



<p>Also if you already understand how the evil twin access point works that???s fine, but if you don&#8217;t know, then let me explain what we&#8217;re going to do for this attack.</p>



<p>First, we&#8217;re going to create an evil twin access point and it&#8217;s called an evil twin because it&#8217;s a clone of an authentic access point. Thus, we find a wireless network that we want to target, we copy that networks identifying information such as its name and its MAC address, and then we use that information to create our own wireless network.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that should only be performed on wireless networks that you own. If you don&#8217;t have two wireless networks, I suggest you ask a neighbor or a friend if you can use theirs to practice on.</p>



<p>When a client connects to the evil twin Network, they won&#8217;t be able to distinguish between the authentic network and the evil twin network. Then, when the client opens their web browser, we&#8217;re going to redirect them to a security update page for the router, which will prompt them to enter their WPA or WPA2 password.</p>



<p>When the client enters his or her WPA password, the password is going to be stored in a my SQL database, which we will create in a few moments. That&#8217;s everything we&#8217;re going to do for this attack.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead and get started. First, we need to connect to the internet and we&#8217;re going to accomplish this by sharing our host operating systems internet connection with our Kali Linux virtual machine. This way, it will eliminate the need for a second USB network adapter. If you jump over to your host operating system that doesn&#8217;t matter what type of operating system you&#8217;re</p>



<p><a></a>using just as long as you can connect to the internet with it.</p>



<p>Go ahead and open your network manager and then find a wireless network to connect to. You can connect to your home network, so once it???s done, now that you are connected to the internet on your host operating system, we need to share it with our Kali Linux virtual machine.</p>



<p>Therefore let&#8217;s move back over to Kali Linux and in the top menu bar we need to open the virtual machine menu and then we&#8217;re going to expand the network adapter menu, and here we need to set our network adapter to bridged auto-detect.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve made that setting, you can go ahead and allow the virtual machine menu to collapse and now we can use that virtual network adapter to establish an internet connection through our host operating system.</p>



<p>Next, open your network manager, you can use whatever network manager you have, and in your network manager you need to find the option that says ???wired network??? and then click ???connect???.</p>



<p>While that&#8217;s connecting I want to point out that if you&#8217;re using the default network manager and you&#8217;re having issues with the wired connection I recommend installing another network manager, such as ???WICD network manager???.</p>



<p>Now that we have an internet connection, we need to install DHCP server and for those of you who don&#8217;t know what a DHCP server is, well a DHCP server is used to assign an IP address within a specific range to clients who connect to an Access Point.</p>



<p>In this case, we&#8217;ll use it to assign an IP address to anyone who connects to our evil twin access point. Go ahead and close your network manager and now we need to open a terminal and in the terminal we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???apt-get install dhcp3-server???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER. I&#8217;ve already installed DHCP server but you may receive a prompt asking you to confirm the installation so just type ???Y??? meaning ???yes??? and then press Enter, and give it a moment to finish installing.</p>



<p>Moving on, we need to configure our DHCP server, so in the terminal let&#8217;s type; ???nano /etc/dhcpd.conf???</p>



<p>and then press enter, and you should have a blank dhcp3 configuration file,</p>



<p><a></a>but if it&#8217;s not blank simply delete the existing contents before moving on. Once you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s start entering our configurations. On the first line we need to type;</p>



<p>???authoritative;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down to the next line and then type;</p>



<p>???default-lease-time 600;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER and move down to the next line and type;</p>



<p>???max-lease-time 7200;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and then type;</p>



<p>???subnet 192.168.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 {???</p>



<p>then press enter to move down the line and type;</p>



<p>???option subnet-mask 255.255.255.128;</p>



<p>then press enter to move down the line and type;</p>



<p>???option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and type;</p>



<p>???option routers 192.168.1.129;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and type;</p>



<p>???option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and type;</p>



<p>???range 192.168.1.130 192.168.1.140;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and type;</p>



<p>then type a backwards-facing curly bracket;</p>



<p>}</p>



<p>and that&#8217;s everything that we need to enter so now we need to save and close the file. But before you do then, double-heck that you have the following configuration in your terminal;</p>



<p><strong><em>authoritative;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>default-lease-time 600;</em></strong></p>



<p><a></a><strong><em>max-lease-time 7200;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>subnet 192.168.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 { option subnet-mask 255.255.255.128;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255; option routers 192.168.1.129;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8; range 192.168.1.130 192.168.1.140;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>}</em></strong></p>



<p>Once you have verified that your configuration is correct, let???s move on and save these configuration.</p>



<p>First we&#8217;re going to press the ???ctrl and X??? keys together, and then we&#8217;ll press the ???Y??? key, and finally we&#8217;ll press the Enter key. Now we need to download the security update page that the client will see when they open their web browser.</p>



<p>This sample web page imitates a security update for a Linksys router, but in a real world penetration test, the sample page I am using will most likely be irrelevant if your pen testing a company that uses a captive portal or a landing page.</p>



<p>For example you would want to deploy a webpage that resembles that company&#8217;s captive portal. If you are pen testing a network that uses Netgear, D-link or Cisco, you want to produce a webpage that identifies with those particular manufacturers.</p>



<p>Once you have downloaded the evil twin zip file, you also need to unzip it. Once complete, we&#8217;re ready to start our Apache web server which will allow us to host our security update webpage. Now we need to type;</p>



<p>???/etc/init.d/apache2 start???</p>



<p>and then press enter and now we need to start My SQL so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???/etc/init.d/mysql start???</p>



<p>and then press Enter and now that My SQL is running, we need to log into it and create a database which is where we&#8217;ll store the WPA password that our client enters into the security update page, so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???mysql ???u root???</p>



<p><a></a>and then press Enter, and you should have the MySQL prompt. Here, we&#8217;re going to create a database named ???evil twin??? so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???create database evil_twin;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER, and now we need to create a table with some columns which will represent the data that the client enters in the password field on our security update page. So to move into our new database, we need to type;</p>



<p>???use evil_twin???</p>



<p>And then press ENTER and now we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???create_table wpa_keys(password varchar(64), confirm varchar(64));???</p>



<p>and then press enter and in case you were wondering that command created a table called ???wpa_keys??? which contains two columns. One is called ???password??? and the other is called ???confirm???.</p>



<p>The 64 represents the maximum number of characters that can be stored in the column, and we use 64 because a WPA password can contain up to 64 characters.</p>



<p>Moving on, we need to find our virtual network adapters interface name and we need to find our local IP address because we&#8217;re going to be using them in future commands.</p>



<p>Thus let&#8217;s open up a new terminal and we can leave the My SQL terminal open because we&#8217;ll be accessing that later on. In the new terminal we need to type;</p>



<p>???ip space???</p>



<p>and then press Enter, and go ahead and find your virtual network adapters interface name and your local IP address. My interface name is ???eth0??? and my local IP address is ???192.168.0.6??? but your might be different.</p>



<p>Open up a blank notepad to keep track of this information and go ahead and represent these items the way as I show you so that we can easily refer to them later on without confusion.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll call our virtual network adapters interface name our wired interface and mine is eth0 and then we&#8217;ll call our local IP address our local IP and mine is 192.168.0.1.</p>



<p><a></a><strong><em>Wired Interface: eth0</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Local IP Address: 192.168.0.6</em></strong></p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve made note of those information, we need to find the name of our USB network adapters interface name. So go ahead and connect your USB network adapter if you haven&#8217;t already done so, and then let&#8217;s move back into the terminal. In the terminal we need to type;</p>



<p>???airmon-ng???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER and go ahead and find your USB network adapters interface name. Your interface name is showing right under the ???Interface??? and then let&#8217;s make note of that in your notepad.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll call it our wireless interface, and mine is wlan0;</p>



<p><strong><em>Wireless Interface: wlan0</em></strong></p>



<p>and now we need to create a monitor interface, so let&#8217;s move back into the terminal, and we need to type;</p>



<p>???airmon-ng start [wlan0]???</p>



<p>and then press enter, then go ahead and find your monitor interface name. The monitor interface is shows within the sentence ???(monitor mode enabled on wlan0)??? and then let&#8217;s make a note of that in your notepad.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll call it our monitor interface and mine is mon0</p>



<p>???Monitor Interface: mon0???</p>



<p>and now we&#8217;re going to use ???airodump??? to find the wireless network that we want to clone, but first I&#8217;m going to share with you something that will allow us to identify the type of router that the target network is using.</p>



<p>Thus let&#8217;s move back into the terminal and type;</p>



<p>???airodump-ng-oui-update???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER. Here, give it a moment to download the ???OUI??? file. This provides us with a list of manufacturers and known MAC address formats. What this does is it allows ???airodump??? to compare the discovered networks BSSIDs to the list, and display the corresponding manufacturer for us in the scan results.</p>



<p>Moving on, let&#8217;s go ahead and start our scan. To do this, we need to type;</p>



<p><a></a>???airodump-ng -M mon0???</p>



<p>and then press enter, and when you find the wireless network that you want to target, you need to press the ???ctrl and C??? keys to stop the scan. Now we need to make note of the targets ???ESSID???, the channel number referenced as ???CH??? and the targets ???BSSID???.</p>



<p>Therefore, let&#8217;s move back into your notepad, and we&#8217;re going to call these items ???Target ESSID???, ???Target Channel Number??? and ???Target BSSID??? so go ahead and refer back to your terminal and write down these details as follows:</p>



<p><strong><em>Target ESSID: freewifi</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Target Channel Number: 6</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Target BSSID: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff</em></strong></p>



<p>Regards to the ESSID, make sure you use any uppercase lowercase as necessary and then write down the channel number where mine is using 6 and then for the BSSID, I recommend simply copying and pasting to ensure that you don&#8217;t make any errors.</p>



<p>To copy text from the Kali terminal without using right-click, you can simply press the ???ctrl shift + C??? keys to copy any text. Same as if you want to paste text, you can press the ???ctrl shift + V??? keys.</p>



<p>Once you have pasted these information into the notepad, now that we have our targets information, we can create an evil twin. So let&#8217;s move back into the terminal and now we need to type;</p>



<p>???airbase-ng ???e freewifi ???c 6 ???P mon0???</p>



<p>Here, you are referencing the targets ESSID, then the targets channel number which is in my case 6, and then enter the name of your monitor interface, where you can see that mine is ???mon0??? and then press Enter.</p>



<p>Now that our evil twin access point is up and running, we need to configure our tunnel interface so we can create a bridge between our evil twin access point and our wired interface.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s go ahead and open up a new terminal, but don&#8217;t close the air base terminal or the My SQL terminal. In the terminal we need to type;</p>



<p>???ifconfig at0 192.168.1.129 netmask 255.255.255.128???</p>



<p><a></a>And then press enter. Now we need to add a routing table and enable IP forwarding so we can forward traffic to and from our evil twin access point, so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???route add -net 192.168.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 gw 192.168.1.129???</p>



<p>and then press enter. Now we need to type;</p>



<p>???echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward???</p>



<p>and then press enter. Now we need to create some iptables rules. These rules will determine how network traffic is handled. First we&#8217;re going to create a rule for managing traffic that needs to go to our wired interface which is our internet source, so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???iptables &#8211; &#8211; table nat &#8211; -append POSTROUTING &#8211; -out-interface eth0 ???j MASQUERADE???</p>



<p>masquerade should be written in all uppercase and then press Enter. Now we need to create a rule for managing traffic that is going into our tunnel interface so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???iptables &#8211; -append FORWARDA &#8211; -in-interface at0 -j ACCEPT???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now we need to create a rule that allows TCP connections on port 80 and forwards them to our web server so we need to type;</p>



<p>???iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING ???p tcp &#8211; -dport 80 ???j DNAT &#8211; -to-destination 192.168.0.6:80???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. For the final rule, we need to create a rule that allows us to provide a network address translation and to do this we need to type;</p>



<p>???iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ???j MASQUERADE???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now that we have IP tables set up, we need to point it to our DHCP D configuration file and start our DHCP server, so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???dhcpd -cf /etc/dhcpd.conf ???pf /var/run/dhcpd.pid at0???</p>



<p>and then press enter. Then type;</p>



<p>???/etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server start???</p>



<p>and then press enter. You should now see the following output:</p>



<p>???Starting ISC DHCP server: dhcpd???</p>



<p>That reflects that dhcp server is started and it started successfully. For the last</p>



<p><a></a>step, we need to force the target networks clients to connect to our evil twin access point.</p>



<p>To accomplish this, we need to disconnect the clients from the target network by performing a deauthentication attack. Keep in mind, there are various ways to do this, but for this attack we&#8217;re going to use MDK3.</p>



<p>First we need to create a blacklist file that contains the target&#8217;s MAC address or BSSID. So let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???echo aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff &gt; blacklist???</p>



<p>aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff here references the targets BSSID, so just go ahead and copy that out of your notepad and then paste it into the terminal to blacklist it as above and then press ENTER.</p>



<p>Then to start the deauthentication attack, we need to type;</p>



<p>???mdk3 mon0 d ???b blacklist ???c 6???</p>



<p>Here, you have to enter the name of your monitor interface and mine is mon0, and then the targets channel number and mine is 6, and then press enter. Now you can move over to the computer that you are using to simulate a victim.</p>



<p>If the deauthentication attack is successful, your victim computer should lose the current connection any moment. Once your victim computer has lost his connection, what&#8217;s going to happen, is that your victim computer will try to re-establish the connection that it just lost, however because we&#8217;ve suspended the authentic network, it should connect to the evil twin network instead.</p>



<p>If you go back over to the airobase terminal to watch for the connection it should show that someone is connected to your evil twin access point. So if you move back over to your victim computer, you can open a web browser and just try to go to google.com.</p>



<p>Here, you should see that you have been brought to a security update page and as a user you want to make sure that your router is current on all of it???s updates, particularly as security updates, so it will ask you to enter your WPA password as the router update is requesting.</p>



<p>Once you confirm the password then click update. Now let&#8217;s move back over to your My SQL terminal and check if you were able to capture the WPA password.</p>



<p><a></a>In the terminal, we need to type;</p>



<p>???use evil_twin???</p>



<p>and press enter. Then we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???select * from wpa_keys;???</p>



<p>and then press Enter, and you should see there the clients password was stored in your My SQL database.</p>



<p>The password should be shown under ???password??? and the confirmed password is under ???confirm??? within the My SQL database.</p>



<p>If the client was to enter a miss matching passwords, they would have been brought to an error page prompting them to re-enter their passwords because they didn&#8217;t match.</p>



<p>If the client was to click the cancel button, they would have been brought to a page that ensures them how important this security update is and that is for their own good and that they will not be able to browse the internet until they perform the update.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how you can create an evil twin access point and set up a web page that&#8217;s going to capture WPA password.</p>



<p>Please make sure you have written authorization before using these tools, as it could cause a serious harm to all networking devices that are connected to the network.</p>



<p>If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

<p><strong>IPv6 Packet Capturing with Parasite6</strong></p>



<p>Imagine that you have a new assignment for penetration testing, and the company has two networks that require being broken into. Yet, one of them is very likely easy as there are no firewalls in place.</p>



<p>But the second network seems like it???s more secured and it might take the whole day to figure out the possible volnaribility to exploit them. Certain people may start with the easy one that could be done under an hour.</p>



<p>But, if you ask the right questions to the current network implementation that is running within the company, you may save yourself from extra head pain and have an easy day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>IPv6 is running as a valid protocol in most computers in companies today. Therefore, by taking certain steps to disable it, you could leverage IPv6 according to its operation and compromise the network by a Man in the Middle attack.</p>



<p>If you are aware of that and understand how to crack it, you may be able to finish your penetration testing within a short period of time, as the company possibly has not enabled all the security features on the network as they should have.</p>



<p>Man in the Middle attack is achievable by many tools and we have discussed some of them already previously. Once we are approaching an IPv6 network, we can use another great tool called ???Parasite6???.</p>



<p>Let???s get back to basics and think of what happens when the PC boots the first time while connected to a network. Of course the PC first would ask for an IP address.</p>



<p>In this case, an IPv6 address from the router that is on the same network, or if there is a DHCP Server, then the DHCP server would assign that IP address to that PC.</p>



<p>Next, if that PC begins to communicate with the outside network or the Internet, first it should learn the Mac address of the router, and that would happen by using ARP or Address Resolution Protocol, but in IPv6 there is no such thing as ARP.</p>



<p>What happenes in IPv6 network instead of ARP is that the PC would use a</p>



<p><a></a>???Neighbour Discovery???, specifically called NDP or Neighbour Discovery Protocol.</p>



<p>What would happen next is that the PC would send out a nighbour discovery, to be more detailed, a neighbour solicitation to it???s router, then the router would reply by a neighbour advertisement.</p>



<p>Solicitations are asking, and advertising is giving the address that has been asked for. That???s all great, but how would we use Parasite6 here?</p>



<p>Well, we would join the network with our Kali Linux machine that is running Parasite6, then begin to listen to the network.</p>



<p>Once Parasite6 is enabled, it would start to listen to every solicited message that goes through the network, and then it would begin to answer.</p>



<p>But, instead of answering with the correct details, we would answer with our own Mac Address to everyone on the network, making every network device on the network believe that we are the router.</p>



<p>We don???t have a Man in the Middle attack yet, instead we have a DoS or Denial of Service attack because every network device that wants to get out to the internet would reach our Kali machine first, thanks to Parasite6 being enabled.</p>



<p>To turn this DoS attack to be a MITM attack, we would have to turn on IPv6 forwarding on, on our Kali Linux machine.</p>



<p>Launching Parasite6 on Kali is simple, all you have to do is type the command:</p>



<p>???parasite6 interface1 (fake mac address)???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Essentially, you have to type parasite6, then specify what interface you want to connect to the network and become a Man in the Middle, then type the fake mac address that you want provide to all other end devices or network devices that are connected to the same network.</p>



<p>For the fake mac address, any made up mac address would work just fine. Other useful commands you can deploy is:</p>



<p>???parasite6 -l interface1 (fake mac address) ???</p>



<p>This time I have added ??????l??? and that would represent a loop, meaning it would create a loop and refresh the solicitation message in every 5 seconds in</p>



<p><a></a>order to keep the poisoned information current. You also have another option if you type:</p>



<p>???parasite6 -r interface1 (fake mac address) ???</p>



<p>This time using ??????r??? representing that it would also try to inject the destination of the solicitation. But, to use both, by keeping all the poisoned fake infomation current as well as poison the destination of the solicitation as well, we should use the following command:</p>



<p>???parasite6 -lr interface1 (fake mac address) ???</p>



<p>Next, by launching this command, it would listen to all the neighbour solicitation messeges that it receives, and begin to respond to them all with it???s own fake address that we have specified.</p>



<p>Please make sure you have written authorization before using Parasite6, including any variations related to Parasite6, as it could cause a serious harm to all networking devices that are connected to the network.</p>



<p>If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">          <strong>Deauthentication Attack against Rogue AP</strong></p>



<p>There are many different techniques to contain a rogue access point in a wireless network and in this scenario; we are going to use WLC to do it. But before thinking about containing a rogue access point, first we have to identify it. Once again, there are several ways to identify a rogue access point, and we already discussed some of them, so instead imagine the following scenario.</p>



<p>Imagine that you are using a channel analyser to identify potential interferers, in an environment where there are several SSIDs broadcasted, but one of them is using an open authentication, while the rest of the SSIDs are all using WPA2-Enterprise for Security.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s very likely that if this is a corporate infrastructure what we would be looking at is some access point that is a rogue device that&#8217;s trying to lure in some customers.</p>



<p>If someone in your environment whether it&#8217;s an airport or at your corporate network, if they&#8217;re emulating or spoofing your SSID trying to lure people in, it&#8217;s very likely malicious.</p>



<p>Secondly, if we have a customer who associates with this rogue access point and starts using it then the attacker who has that rogue access point can now perform a man-in-the-middle attack and eavesdrop on all traffic.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do. We&#8217;re going to use a Wireless LAN Controller also references as ???WLC??? because the WLC knows exactly which access points it manages.</p>



<p>The good thing is that these access points they are not by default just sitting there servicing their customers on their respective channels, but they&#8217;re also periodically scanning the other channels, gathering information which they feed back to the wireless LAN controller.</p>



<p>Part of that information it gathers is information about access points that they see. When the wireless LAN controller sees an access point that it doesn&#8217;t manage, it isn&#8217;t part of the wireless controller family, it&#8217;s going to classify that access point as ???rogue???.</p>



<p>Thus our very first step inside the WLC is to take a look and see if the controller knows about any rogue access points, and after we find that access</p>



<p><a></a>point, we&#8217;ll take the next logical step, and that is to contain it from the controller.</p>



<p>On the WLCs main page the ???monitor??? page in the upper right hand corner it&#8217;s going to show us the details regarding active rogue access points under ???Rogue Summary???</p>



<p>If you use a WLC, you might see several devices listed in there and ask; well how comes there are so many rogue access points? There might be several reasons to this. For example your WLC might see 10 or even more Rogue access points, and they might be all completely legeit, is just that your WLC is not managing those, therefore classifies them as rogue.</p>



<p>All those other broadcasted SSIDs that are being seen by one or more of those access points that the WLC manages and it&#8217;s being reported back to the controller and that&#8217;s why the controller puts them in the category of rogue.</p>



<p>It simply doesn&#8217;t know who those devices are. To take a look at the details of these rogue access points, we simply click on the ???detail??? link and what we&#8217;re going to see is the list of Access points including their mac addresses, SSIDs, Channel they are using, how many radios they are using, how many clients are connected to them.</p>



<p>To learn more about the device, we can click on it???s mac address, and it will take us to the ???Rouge AP Detail??? window. Here, if we look at the details of that access point we can the MAC address of the device, the first time it was seen by the WLC, the last time was reported to the WLC, and down below, near the bottom there are the access points that are reported it in the first place.</p>



<p>There, we can see that the AP or Aps are reporting that they saw the rogue access point on what channel and they&#8217;re also including information such as a receive signal strength indicator, and the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>



<p>Now you might be asking; well that&#8217;s great and we know that we have a rogue access point, but how do we contain that device, how do we shut them down?</p>



<p>Well, we&#8217;re gong to take our access points which besides supporting normal customers, and also going to spend a little bit of extra time the ones that can currently see that rogue access point and they are going to perform effectively a denial of service attack against that access point.</p>



<p><a></a>It&#8217;s going to do that by using ???deauthentication??? messages. Now if a customer is trying to associate with that rogue access point, because these ???deauthentication??? messages are being sent by the access points, these access points are also going to spoofed, which is a nice way of saying lie about the MAC address involved, so that our customer or any other customers who are trying to work with the rogue access point are going to be attacked with ???deauthentication??? messages.</p>



<p>The goal here is to make sure that access point which is not managed by us to make sure that no valid customers associate with that. Also want to point out something very important regarding shutting down or doing ???deauthentication attack??? access point.</p>



<p>Attacking your own access point is not a big deal, however I need to point out that attacking somebody else&#8217;s wireless local area network is a big deal and you definitely would not ever want to do that against any other legitimate networks, because it will cause a denial of service attack against that network.</p>



<p>So to do that looking at the details of the rogue AP, all we need to do is go under ???update status??? and change to ???contain??? instead of ???alert???. Next, the question is how many access points should we use to go ahead and deal with that containment.</p>



<p>The containment can be defined under the title; ???Maximum number of Aps to contain the rogue??? Here, if you only have one access point that is currently able to see the rogue device, you can only select one to send the ???deauthentication??? messages.</p>



<p>Once selected, then click on ???apply??? to make that change and it gives a little warning saying;</p>



<p>???There may be legal issues following this containment. Are you sure you want to continue????</p>



<p>As I pointed it out earlier, this could be illegal, but if you own the access point, you can click on ???OK???. Now, a ???deauthentication attack??? will happen against that rogue access point, and it will remain in place until we turn that off.</p>



<p>If you are still on the same page under ???Rogue AP Detail??? next to the ???State??? the status will say ???contained??? which is want we wanted to achieve. If we want to turn that off and take off the attack, we&#8217;ll simply change the status</p>



<p><a></a>back to ???alert???, click on ???apply??? and the ???deauthentication??? attacks will be stopped.</p>



<p>In the meanwhile if you have protocol analyser, you can see the rogue access point???s frame number, and if you follow the stream, under ???Type/Subtype??? you will see ???Deauthentication??? which is the ???deauthentication attack??? that we have implemented with the AP using our WLC against the rogue access point.</p>



<p>Although it looks like the source MAC address is involved, these are being initiated by our own access points to do an attack. If you keep following that stream, go down further it&#8217;s going to continue over and over until we have stop the attack on the WLC.</p>



<p>The goal is to make sure that no valid clients accidentally associate with the rogue access point, or if they do, they won&#8217;t be on there very long because of the periodic ???deauthentication??? messages which are coming through will disassociate the clients connected to it.</p>



<p>As you see, if you have a WLC in your organization, you can quickly identify and contain rogue access points. But once again I would like to remind you that attacking somebody else&#8217;s wireless local area network is not legal, and you can be in trouble doing it, so make sure that you have written authorization or your manager???s approval to carry out such containment using WLC or any other tools.</p>

<p><strong>Packet Manipulation with Scapy</strong></p>



<p>Scapy is an advanced packet manipulating tool that is not revommended for beginners to play with. Yet, it???s fair to mention that this tool exists and certainly can act like the King of all hacking tools out there.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Network Discovery with Scapy- Kali LinuxFull Course (Part - 14) By PakFreeDownloadSpot.blogspot.com" frameborder="0" width="768" height="431" src="https://geo.dailymotion.com/player.html?video=x2cn4en&#038;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Scapy</figcaption></figure>



<p>Scapy can assist you to craft virtually any packet that you want to, without any problem. Imagine that you are about to administer and validate a configuration on a Firewall, and one of the policies dictates that you implement the following rule:</p>



<p><em>???Any packet initiated from inbound direction to outbound direction are not allowed, so should be denyied if the destination IP address is the same as the source IP address.???</em></p>



<p>This Firewall Rule Request of course makes perfect sense but it also sounds a little unrealistic. Just think about how it it possible that a PC sends a request from it???s own IP address to the outbound direction where the destination IP address would be the exact same identical IP address as the sender???s PC.</p>



<p>That???s impossible right?</p>



<p>Well, technically it is possible, because this could be a malicious packet.</p>



<p>Someone may be about to run some port scan within the organization to gain data on networking devices and their vulnerabilities to launch a strategic attack, that could potentially damage, disable, clone or even shutdown the whole system, and it would seem that the it was originated from inside private network.</p>



<p>So how is that possible? Well, the tool is called Scapy. Scapy is very likely the most powerful and flexible packet manipulation tool that is built into Kali Linux, written by Phyton.</p>



<p>Using Scapy, by opening the command line interface we can launch it and create a packet, and the best part is that we can specify virtually anything:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Any source IP address,</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Any destination IP address,</li><li>Type of service,</li><li>We can create IPv4 Address or IPv6 Address,</li><li>Change any of the header field,</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the destination port number,</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Change the source port number and more.</li></ul>



<p>In addition, to craft a unique packet, Scapy is also able to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Capture any Traffic,</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Play or replay any traffic,</li><li>Scan for ports,</li><li>Discover networking devices and more.</li></ul>



<p>Scapy works in Kali Linux, and to launch it on the command line interface by typing:</p>



<p>???scapy???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Because there are so many possibilities with scapy, let???s begin by starting something straight forward and that would be a basic send command:</p>



<p>???send(IP(src=??????10.10.10.20?????? ,dst=??????10.10.10.2??????)/ICPM()/??????OurPayload??????#)???</p>



<p>What this packet creation command means here is that, I want to send a ping from the source IP address of 10.10.10.20, to the destination IP address of 10.10.10.2.</p>



<p>Additionally, I want this packet to look like an ICMP echo request, but I want it to include a Payload that is called OurPayload. Scapy is a rule breaker.</p>



<p>Therefore, we don???t have to do anything exactly as it should be according to proper networking protocols, instead we can create packets that logically would never be found in the network.</p>



<p>By sending crafted packets to multiple destinations, we could just wait for the responses and take a look at them and see if we might have created some weird behavior, and we could discover a vulnerability in this process.</p>



<p>To exit from Scapy, you have to press ???Ctrl+d??? and that would take you back to a normal command prompt. But, if you want to initiate another command you must start Scapy again by typing a command;</p>



<p>???scapy???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Another command that is very dangerous, is when we turn</p>



<p><a></a>Scapy to become a sniffer. If you type;</p>



<p>???sniff(iface=??????eth0??????, prn=lambda x: x.show())???</p>



<p>Then press enter, this means that I want you to sniff all traffic that goes through the interface ethernet0, and I want you to display every single packet as it comes and goes through you.</p>



<p>After you press <em>enter</em>, the output would propably fill this book; but I wanted to share with you that Scapy is not only capable of crafting packets, but it can become an intruder or sniffer if we wanted to.</p>

</div><figcaption>Python and Scaly on Android</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using Scapy in a live or production environment. If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

<p><strong>MITM Attack with SSLstrip</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to teach you how to create a fake access point on a Kali Linux virtual machine. To complete this attack you will need to have a USB network adapter that supports both monitor mode and master mode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="How To: Use SSLstrip On Kali Linux" frameborder="0" width="768" height="480" src="https://geo.dailymotion.com/player.html?video=x6fwm3f&#038;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Use SSLstrip on Kali Linux</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a USB network adapter that supports these networking modes the network adapter that I highly recommend is the Alpha that I have talked about earlier. It only cost about $50 and you can pick one up from Amazon as well as a few other places.</p>

</div><figcaption>DHCP Exhaustion and MiTM Attacks</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before we begin I want to explain how this attack works. To illustrate it let me give you a high-level overview of how this attack works. The main components include the victim, the attacker, the fake access point and a router with an internet connection.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s happening, is the attacker is connected to the Internet, and the attacker is going to share that internet connection through a USB network adapter which is acting as a fake access point.</p>



<p>When someone connects to that fake access point, they&#8217;ll be able to access the Internet. Let me walk you through this process. The first thing that&#8217;s going to happen is the victim is going to connect to the fake access point, then the victims internet traffic will be routed through the fake access point into the attacker.</p>



<p>Once the attacker obtains the victims Internet traffic, the attacker will manipulate and log the victims internet traffic with SSL strip and this is going to allow the attacker to force the victim to use HTTP, which as a result is also going to allow the attacker to capture any usernames and passwords that the victim enters.</p>



<p>Once SSL strip is finished manipulating and logging the victims internet traffic, the attacker will forward the victims internet traffic to the router. Finally, the router will route the victims Internet traffic to whatever website the victim is attempting to communicate with.</p>



<p>What we do here, is that we place ourselves between the victim and the web site so as a consequence, we can see any interactions that are occurring between the victim and the web site, and this is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>



<p><a></a>That concludes the explanation, so let&#8217;s go ahead and get started with the attack. The first thing that we need to do is connect to the internet, and we&#8217;re going to accomplish this by sharing our host operating systems internet connection with our Kali Linux virtual machine.</p>



<p>This is essentially a bridged or a wired network connection and I&#8217;ve chosen to do it this way so I can eliminate the need for a second USB network adapter, but keep in mind if you do have a second USB network adapter, you can use it to connect to the internet directly from your Kali Linux virtual machine.</p>



<p>Instead, I am going to us the method that I&#8217;m about to share with you. Let&#8217;s go ahead and logon to our host operating system. It does not matter what type of computer you are running your Kali Linux virtual machine on as long as you can use it to connect to the Internet.</p>



<p>First, go ahead and open the network settings or whatever network management application your operating system uses. I can access mine from the top menu bar and then let&#8217;s find a wireless network to connect to.</p>



<p>Keep in mind you can connect to any network that you&#8217;d like to as long as it has an internet connection and if you&#8217;re mobile you can tether to your Android or your iPhones that uses a 4G USB modem, a mobile hotspot or whatever means of an internet connection you have.</p>



<p>Once connected to the internet on your host operating system, you need to share it with our Kali Linux virtual machine.</p>



<p>So now, go ahead and move over to our Kali Linux virtual machine, and in the top menu bar you need to open the virtual machine menu, and then expand the network adapter menu.</p>



<p>If you have multiple network adapters, use the one at the top. It should be called network adapter and it should not have any numbers following it.</p>



<p>Here, we need to make sure that we&#8217;ve set our network adapter to use bridged auto-detect and this is going to allow us to obtain an IP address and an internet connection from the router that our host operating system is connected to.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve made that setting, you can go ahead and allow the virtual machine menu to collapse and now we can use that virtual network to establish an internet connection.</p>



<p><a></a>Next, let&#8217;s open up our network manager, by the way, you can use whatever network manager you have, and here, you need to find the option that says ???Wired Network??? and then click ???connect???.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re using the default network manager you should be connected automatically, but if you are not, you may need to reboot your virtual machine and you should be given a connection.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re still experiencing issues, I recommend installing the ???Wicd??? network manager. Moving on, now that we have an internet connection, we need to find our gateway IP address and make note of it.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead and close the network manager, and let&#8217;s open a terminal where you need to type:</p>



<p>???route space ???n???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER, and go ahead and find your gateway IP address. In my setup it is 192.168.0.1, and we need to make note of this because we&#8217;re going to use it in a future command.</p>



<p>You can open a notepad or if you want you can use a piece of paper whatever is convenient for you and write down your gateway IP address. Now that we&#8217;ve made note of our gateway IP address, we need to install DHCP server.</p>



<p>Back into the Kali terminal, we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???apt-get install dhcp3-server???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER. Just be patient and allow it enough time to finish installing the DHCP server, and once the installation is complete we need to configure our DHCP server.</p>



<p>Back to the terminal, let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???nano /etc/dhcpd.conf???</p>



<p>and then press enter, and you should have a blank DHCP D configuration file. If it isn&#8217;t blank for some reason, just go ahead and delete all of the contents and when you&#8217;re ready let&#8217;s start adding our settings.</p>



<p>First we need to type:</p>



<p>???authoritative;</p>



<p>and then press ENTER and move down a line, and then type;</p>



<p><a></a>???default-lease-time 600;</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line, and type;</p>



<p>???max-lease-time 7200;???</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line, and then type;</p>



<p>???subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {</p>



<p>Above after space, it???s called ???forward facing curly bracket??? and then press ENTER, and move down a line and then type;</p>



<p>option routers 192.168.1.1;</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and type;</p>



<p>???option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;???</p>



<p>Then press ENTER and move down a line, and type;</p>



<p>???option domain-name ???freewifi???;</p>



<p>Then press ENTER and move down a line and type;</p>



<p>???option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;</p>



<p>and then press ENTER and move down a line and type;</p>



<p>???range 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.30;</p>



<p>}</p>



<p>and then press ENTER to move down a line and then enter a backwards-facing curly bracket. That&#8217;s everything we need to enter. Once again, your configuration should look like this:</p>



<p><strong><em>authoritative; default-lease-time 600; max-lease-time 7200;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { option routers 192.168.1.1;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0; option domain-name ???freewifi???;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1; range 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.30;</em></strong></p>



<p><a></a><strong><em>}</em></strong></p>



<p>Next, you need to save the changes that we&#8217;ve made, so press the ???ctrl + x??? keys and then to save the file. You need to press the ???Y??? key and then to write the file and close it.</p>



<p>You need to press ENTER, and now we need to find the name of our USB network adapter, so go ahead and connect your USB network adapter if you haven&#8217;t already done so, and in the terminal we need to type:</p>



<p>???airmon-ng???</p>



<p>and press enter, and you should see the name of your network adapter listed below. Mine is called ???wlan0??? yours will probably something similar. Now that we know the name of our network adapter, we need to start monitor mode so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???airmon-ng start wlan0???</p>



<p>and then press enter, and give it a moment to create a monitor interface for you. A message will popup there to say that a monitor interface has been created and it&#8217;s called ???mon0???.</p>



<p>Now we need to create our fake access point so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???airbase-ng ???c 11 -e freewifi mon0???</p>



<p>For ???mon0??? you have to enter the name of your monitor interface. In mine case is ???mon0??? then press enter and now that our fake access point is up and running we need to make some adjustments to our tunnel interface which is an interface that ???airbase??? automatically created for us when we started our fake access point.</p>



<p>Therefore let&#8217;s open a new terminal, but do not close the terminal that we&#8217;re running an airbase in, because we need it to continue operating. In the new terminal, we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???ifconfig at0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0???</p>



<p>and then press enter. Now we need to adjust the MTU which stands for maximum transmission units. What MTU does is that it allows our tunnel interface to transmit larger packets so that we can prevent packet fragmentation.</p>



<p>In the simpler terms, this allows our fake access point to manage higher</p>



<p><a></a>volumes of Internet traffic, which is generated by anyone who connects to our fake access point. In the terminal, let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???ifconfig at0 mtu 1400???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now we need to add a routing table, so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 GW 192.168.1.1???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now we need to enable IP forwarding and create some IP tables rules so that we can use our tunnel interface to route traffic between our fake access point and our internet source. Therefore, we need to type;</p>



<p>???echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now we need to enter our IP tables rules so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???iptables -t nat &#8211;A PREROUTING -p udp -j DNAT &#8211;to 192.168.0.1???</p>



<p>Here, we need to enter the gateway IP address that we made note of earlier, and mine is 192.168.0.1 then press ENTER. Now we need to type;</p>



<p>???iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT???</p>



<p>The words, forward and accept are should be typed in with all uppercase, and then press ENTER. Now we need to type;</p>



<p>???iptables &#8211;append FORWARD ??? in-interface at0 -j ACCEPT??? and then press Enter. Now we need to type;</p>



<p>???iptables ???table nat &#8211;append POSTROUTING &#8211;out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Finally, we need to type;</p>



<p>???iptables -t nat ???A PREROUTING -p tcp ???destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT &#8211;port 10000???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now that we&#8217;ve created our iptables rules, we need to start our DHCP server. So let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???dhcpd ???cf /etc/dhcpd.conf -pf /var/run/dhcpd.pid at0???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Then type;</p>



<p>???/etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server start???</p>



<p>and then press enter, and you should see there that the DHCP server started successfully. Basically, it should say:</p>



<p>???[???.] Starting ISC DHCP server: dhcpd???</p>



<p><a></a>Now it&#8217;s time to start the SSL strip, so let&#8217;s type;</p>



<p>???sslstrip -f -p -k 10000???</p>



<p>and then press enter. Last but not least, we need to start edit app so let&#8217;s open a new terminal but do not close the terminal that we&#8217;re running an SSL strip in. In the new terminal we&#8217;re going to type;</p>



<p>???ettercap -p -U -T -q -i at0???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now that we have SSL strip and ettercap running, we are finished setting up the attack. Now we can simulate a victim so we can use our fake access point to capture some usernames and passwords.</p>



<p>So now if you jump over to the victim???s computer, the first thing you can do is connect to the fake access point. Open the network manager, and scan nearby wireless networks, and you should see there our fake access point called ???freewifi???</p>



<p>Go ahead and connect to it and assuming that we set everything up correctly you should have an internet connection. Check and see if you have an assigned IP address from the DHCP pool that we have created before.</p>



<p>In the example I have provided, we have created a DHCP server that can assign IP addresses to connected devices, and we have created a range between 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.30 with the command</p>



<p>???range 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.30???</p>



<p>Under the DHCP configuration. So your victims IP address should be within that range. As a victim, you can log into your Facebook page and you will find out if SSL strip is working or not.</p>



<p>You can use either Firefox, or Google Chrome, and you will see that either if you try to type in the browser http://www.facebook .com, it will change the address to www.facebook.com</p>



<p>This means that the SSL strip is working and if you look at the top left tab in the browser, you&#8217;ll notice a lock icon.</p>



<p>This is an icon that SSL strip places there to add a little legitimacy and this prevents the victim from becoming too suspicious, because they see this lock and automatically assumed it must be secure.</p>



<p>So, next go ahead and enter an email and a password into facebook. You use</p>



<p><a></a>use a fictitious username and password such as ???testuser??? and use the password ???password123???.</p>



<p>It doesn???t matter what username or password you use, as you the point is not for you to log on to facebook, but the fact that we can capture both the username and password credentials.</p>



<p>Before you click login, go back over to the attacker machine and let&#8217;s monitor at the ettercap terminal. Now you can go ahead and click login on facebook, and if you look at the ettercap terminal, you should see data coming through.</p>



<p>You should notice both the username next to the field ???USER??? and the password next to the filed ???PASS???.</p>



<p>If you would try the example with an online banking website, it is highly likely that the username and password is not going to appear in the ettercap terminal, but it will appear in the SSL strip logs.</p>



<p>You can try to log into accounts and you will not see the username and password in the terminal, but SSL strip will grab them and placing them into a log.</p>



<p>So, go ahead and move back over to the attacker computer, and here you need to open a new terminal and type;</p>



<p>???cat sslstrip.log???</p>



<p>and then press Enter. Now, you should see both username and password.</p>



<p>The user details will appear in the logs as ???userId=username??? and the password will appear as ???auth_passwd=password???</p>



<p>Those are all the examples that I wanted to share with you but keep in mind that this attack is expandable.</p>



<p>For example there is a tool called ???karma??? and what this does is when a computer is looking for a wireless network to connect to specifically a wireless network that is connected to in the past, it sends out probe requests.</p>



<p>Well, we can create something that will allow us to accept those probe requests and then spoof the wireless network that the person is looking for.</p>



<p>When it responds, they&#8217;re going to think that they found that wireless network and their computer is going to automatically connect. There are many things</p>



<p><a></a>you can do with this but for now it&#8217;s time to move on to the next attack.</p>



<p>You can close the terminal that we use to view the SSL strip log. Then to stop ettercap, you will have to press the ctrl and C Keys and then you can close that terminal.</p>



<p>Then to stop the SSL strip you can press ctrl + C to close terminal. To stop your fake access point, also press ctrl + C in the kali window, and then close the terminal.</p>



<p>All those iptables rules that we have created, they will automatically be restored back to the default when you reboot your virtual machine.</p>



<p>Please make sure you have written authorization before using SSLstrip, including any variations related to this tool. If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>MITM Attack with Ettercap</strong></p>



<p>In this chapter we&#8217;re going to discuss how to use Ettercap to capture credentials, specifically usernames and passwords from a target using HTTP and FTP.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Ettercap in Kali Linux,  Kali Linux Full Course (part-36)" frameborder="0" width="768" height="431" src="https://geo.dailymotion.com/player.html?video=x2cu6ux&#038;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ethercap in Kali Linux</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is possible if the target is using two unencrypted protocols such as HTTP and FTP. In the setup we have a Linux and a Windows 10 system, and we&#8217;re going to use Ettercap to put ourselves in the middle between the default gateway which is the Windows host machine.</p>



<p>To get the default gateway address you have to type in a terminal;</p>



<p>???ip route???</p>



<p>In my case the default gateways is 192.168.100.1, but whatever address you have, this is the main information that you need to know for Ettercap to work.</p>



<p>Technically you can put yourselves between everybody on a subnet and the default gateway or individual target if you want to. In this scenario we&#8217;ll put ourselves between everyone and the default gateway.</p>



<p>First within Kali Linux, go to ???Applications???, then scroll down and select ???Sniffing and Spoofing??? then select ???Ettercap-g???. This is the GUI for Ettercap. Once the GUI is open, select ???sniff??? then select ???unified sniffing??? and this will bring up the next window.</p>



<p>In the new window that is now open called ???ettercap Input??? it will ask you what network interface you want to sniff on. There is only one NIC, or network interface card on our Kali machines which is what unifies sniffing.</p>



<p>Therefore whatever interface is shown, you should go with that, so select ???ok??? Next, before we put ourselves in the middle with Ettercap, we have to configure out the target. To do this, select ???hosts??? then ???scan for hosts???.</p>



<p>This will scan the subnet that your target is located. You can only put yourself in the middle on a given subnet with ???arp poisoning???, which is what we&#8217;re going to use.</p>



<p>Once the scan completed, go back and select ???hosts???, then ???hosts list??? and in the new window, you should see IP Addresses that the previous scan found. Here, you should also find the IP Address of your default gateway, which in my case is 192.168.100.1.</p>



<p><a></a>Now you have to create targets, so if you click on the IP address of 192.168.100.1 or whichever IP address is your default gateway, then select ???Add to Target 1???.</p>



<p>Next, if you have more IP Addresses listed, you want to target them too, so once again, you can highlight them by clicking on them, and then click on ???Add to Target 2???.</p>



<p>Once you have selected your targets, go to the top window, then select ???Mitm??? this refer to ???man in the middle??? then you can select ???arp poisoning???. Once you have selected these, there is a new window will popu, you you should tick ???Sniff remote connections??? and click ???ok???</p>



<p>If you are in the middle, or I should say if the Kali Linux machine is in the middle between the Windows 10 machine and the default gateway, the MAC address for IP address 192.168.100.1 should be the MAC address of the Kali Linux machine. To verify that, you should go to the Windows 10 machine???s command line, and type:</p>



<p>???arp- a???</p>



<p>Arp stands for Address Resolution Protocol, and what it does, is that it translates Mac Addresses to IP addresses, and once you use that command on Windows, you should see the list of IP Addresses and next to each their associated MAC addresses.</p>



<p>By the way, make sure you are not confused, as Windows references IP Addresses as ???Internet Addresses??? and references MAC addresses as ???Physical Addresses???</p>



<p>As you see ???Physical Addresses??? technically wrong because using Ettercap you just changed the Mac Address of your default gateway, but to be 100% sure, you can also verify the Kali Linux mac address.</p>



<p>To do that, go back to Kali Linux terminal, and type:</p>



<p>???ifconfig???</p>



<p>And within the output this command shows you, search for the term ???ether??? which references the MAC or ???physical address??? of your Kali Linux Ethernet address.</p>



<p>Once you verified and the Kali ether address is the same as the Windows default gateway, you know that you are in the middle with Ettercap. Now the</p>



<p><a></a>good thing about Ettercap is when you&#8217;re in the middle that&#8217;s pretty much all you have to do is run it.</p>



<p>Within your Ettercap window, down at the bottom if it sees any credentials passed in clear-text, it&#8217;ll capture them to that window. Within the Ettercap window you will see the username next to ???USER??? and the password next to ???PASS???.</p>



<p>It will just pop up on the left side automatically, so don&#8217;t have to do a whole lot. For example you don&#8217;t have to sit there and look at all the traffic like with Wireshark, as both the username and password just pops up.</p>



<p>Ettercap captures any username and password if unencrypted protocols are used, therefore instead of HTTP, HTTPS should be user, wheras, instead of FTP, you should use SFTP, or SCP to transfer files.</p>



<p>The end user never notices while you are in the middle because there are no warning banner that pops up to the user, so they won&#8217;t notice if you do a layer2 man-in-the-middle attack with Ettercap.</p>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using this method in a live or production environment, as any type of Man in the Middle attack is very dangerous.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Traffic Capturing with Xplico</strong></p>



<p>We can launch a Man in the Middle attack in multiple ways, either by using Burp Suite or EtterCAP; but we have never discussed how we can collect the data and analyse them and what tool we may use for that purpose.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cyber Secrets 1x11: Forensic Network Analysis using Wireshark and Networkminer" frameborder="0" width="768" height="431" src="https://geo.dailymotion.com/player.html?video=x1gbxw9&#038;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Forensic Network Analysis</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have discussed a software called Wireshark previously and how we can capture data with it, yet there is another utility that we can use for the same purpose called ???Xplico???.</p>



<p>Xplico can take Wireshark files as well and analyse them for you. Wireshark also has the ability to do a direct feed into Xplico therefore we can capture all the traffic and it can give another great view of what is happening within that session that we are eavesdropping on.</p>



<p>Xplico also comes as a default built in tool within Kali Linux. To launch the Graphical User Interface you can follow the menu options as:</p>



<p>Kali Linux &gt; Forensics &gt; Network Forensics &gt; xplico web gui</p>



<p>Once you have selected the mentioned menu options, it will launch a webserver on Kali. If the Apache webserver is not running yet, you normally have to start it manually; but if you do use your Kali machine, it will automatically start it for you.</p>



<p>If Apache is already running in the background, Xplico will use that server function to launch itself. Next, it would tell you to use a specific URL to open Xplico, using a webserver.</p>



<p>You might choose to click on the provided link to open Xplico, or you can just copy and paste the address to yor browser session. The link is: ../../../index.html:9876/</p>



<p>Another method to launch Xplico is to right click on the provided link, then select Open Link, and it would open it within the default browser; but it???s fair to mention that some of the menu functions do not always work within the default browser.</p>



<p>I would therefore suggest you to use Firefox browser by copy pasting the provided link. Next, Xplico would open up a web based Graphical User Interface that would require you to be logged on using the following details:</p>



<p>???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Username: xplico</p>



<p><a></a>???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: xplico</p>



<p>Once logged on as xplico, to analyse the data that you have previously captured on the network interface ethernet0, you need to create a new case by clicking on a menu option: Case &gt; new case &gt; Live acquisition.</p>



<p>If you want to analyse an existing file that you have saved previously, you can choose to click the radio bar called: ???Uploading PCAP capture file/s???</p>



<p>Once you create a case, you can name it whatever project it is you are doing, then you can create multiple sessions within each project and start to view them.</p>



<p>Xplico will provide clear visibility of any website, Images or videos that the victim has visited, either as a live capture format or by replaying them at any other date at any time.</p>



<p>Likewise, we can capture VOIP (Voice over IP) traffic, that we can also spoof, delete or listen to at any time in the future. Xplico is more then just a data capture tool, but due its power it is also known as a very good hacking tool.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Capturing SYN Scan Attack</strong></p>



<p>The TCP SYN Scan relies on the 3-way handshake process to determine which ports are open on a target host. The attacker sends a TCP SYN packet to a range of ports on the victim, like it???s trying to establish a channel for normal communication on the ports.</p>

</div><figcaption>NMAP</figcaption></figure>



<p>When a SYN scan is executed, the attacker will be looking for three states. Either the port is open, closed, or filtered. Normal TCP handshake works like this.</p>



<p>First, a SYN packet will be sent, then the server will reply with a SYN/ACK and finally, the client will send an ACK packet.</p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the Open Port scenario. If a service on the victim&#8217;s machine is listening on the port, that receives the SYN packet, and it will reply to the attacker with a TCP SYN/ACK packet, and then the attacker knows that the port is open and a service is listening on it.</p>



<p>For the Closed Port scenario, if no service is listening on a scanned port, the attacker will not receive a SYN/ACK packet. Depending on the configuration of the victim&#8217;s operating system, but the attacker could receive a reset packet in return, indicating that the port is closed.</p>



<p>Lastly, for the Filtered Port scenario, the attacker may receive no response at all. That could mean that the port is filtered by an intermediate device, such as a firewall, or the host itself.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it could just be that the response was lost in transit. In this scenario, imagine that you have three hosts; the attacker which is going to use Kali Linux at 10.0.0.111, the victim machine will be a Windows 10 host at 10.0.0.202, finally the penetration tester will use Kali Linux to intercept all the traffic and analyse any attacks on the network.</p>



<p>Imagine yourself that you are the attacker. First, the hacker is going to execute a port scan against your victim Windows 10 machine, and he is going to use nmap to scan the Windows host at the IP address of 10.0.0.202. The command will be used here is:</p>



<p>???nmap 10.0.0.202???</p>



<p>From the attacker perspective, the scan is complete, but he doesn&#8217;t know that</p>



<p><a></a>a penetration tester is listening at this moment on the network.</p>



<p>If you switch to the penetration tester machine and try to catch this intruder, the best ways to understand the scope of a scan is to view the conversations window in Wireshark.</p>



<p>Up in the Wireshark menu, select the ???Statistics??? item, then click on ???Conversations???, and then select the ???IPv4??? tab.</p>



<p>There, you should see only one IPv4 conversation between the attacker at the IP address of 10.0.0.111 and the victim at the IP address of 10.0.0.202.</p>



<p>You will also see that there are thousands of TCP conversations between these two hosts. Basically, a new conversation for every port involved in the communications, which is a lot.</p>



<p>Once understanding the different types of responses a SYN scan can produce, the next logical thought is to find a fast method of identifying which ports are open or closed.</p>



<p>The answer lies within the conversations window. Once again, click on the ???TCP??? tab. In that window, you can sort the TCP conversations by ???packet number??? with the highest values at the top, by clicking the ???Packets??? column twice.</p>



<p>Then you should click on ???scanned ports??? and include 3 packets in each of their conversations. You can take a look at the details of the first packet in the list by clicking on the ???Follow Stream??? button, then close this window, and minimize the conversations window.</p>



<p>Back in the main window of Wireshark, you should see the initial SYN packet sent from the attacker machine, and then the corresponding SYN/ACK packet from the victim&#8217;s host and the final reset packet sent from the attacker&#8217;s host to end the conversation.</p>



<p>If you switch back to the ???Conversations??? window, you can also have some other scenarios where only 2 packets involved in the communication.</p>



<p>If you check the details again, check the first initial SYN packet and the second that is the reset from the victim, which indicates that this port is closed.</p>



<p>If the remaining entries in the ???conversation??? window include only one packet that means that the victim host never responded to the initial SYN</p>

<p><strong>Passive Reconnaissance with Kali</strong></p>



<p>Anybody can listen to the wireless signals that are going over the air. When you listen to wireless signals, you can tune your radio to listen for specific traffic that&#8217;s going to and from a client, or to and from an access point or you can just listen to everything and then filter out what you want to listen to at a later time.</p>



<p>Just like as if you put your hand up to your ear to help you hear better or maybe a glass up to the wall to hear the conversation on the other side of the wall, with wireless, you can use a directional antenna to collect more signal strength from a given direction.</p>



<p>What that means is that I can be some distance away from the access point or from your client, and still be able to capture traffic over the air. What that means is that you don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m eavesdropping on your traffic.</p>



<p>But how can I listen and capture traffic? Well, I am listening by tuning my radio to the frequency channel, collecting all of the signals, processing those signals up my protocol stack, and then displaying them with a packet analyzer tool such as Wireshark.</p>



<p>Listening over the air is one of the best ways to do passive reconnaissance. Passive reconnaissance is when you&#8217;re gathering information about a network, corporation or an individual, but you&#8217;re not actively engaging with the system, the network or with the individual.</p>



<p>You might be gathering information such as what is the manufacturer of their access points? What are the MAC addresses that are being used by the clients? What security mechanisms is a particular company uses? What are the network names? Do they have guess access set up on these access points? Do they have hidden network names?</p>



<p>By information gathering, as you&#8217;re starting to form a picture of the deployment, so then you can go on to the second phase when you&#8217;re starting to plan how you&#8217;re going to attack the network.</p>



<p>Through the passive reconnaissance phase, you&#8217;d be writing down and forming a network map where the access points are deployed, writing their names down and creating a blueprint of deployment and identifying any weaknesses that the network might have. If a hacker is going to try and</p>



<p><a></a>access an enterprise network, wireless has to be one of the top three approaches for uncovering information in order to plan that attack.</p>



<p>To capture and display traffic going over the air you need a tool called Wireshark. You can download Wireshark form their website listed previously, or you can use the tool that&#8217;s already available in Kali Linux.</p>



<p>To do it within Kali Linux, we&#8217;re going to follow a four step process. The first thing we&#8217;re going to do is to put our wireless adapter into monitor mode. That&#8217;s going to enable our adapter to sniff everything over the air, capture everything, and pass it up to the Wireshark application to be displayed and then we can analyze those packets.</p>



<p>We can select everything over the air or we can look for traffic from a specific BSSID or on a specific channel. Once we&#8217;ve selected the BSSID and/or the channel, then we can open Wireshark, select the monitoring interface that we have set up for our wireless adapter and start capturing data. Once we&#8217;ve capture enough data we can save that packet capture to then analyze at a later time.</p>



<p>The first thing we want to do is to put our adapter into monitor mode. In the previous chapter we already discussed how to do that, but you can check to make sure that your wireless interface is still in monitoring mode by typing:</p>



<p>???iwconfig???</p>



<p>This will allows you to see what mode your wireless interface is in, but if you haven???t done any other changes then we have discussed so far, your wlan should be still in Monitoring mode.</p>



<p>There are a number of ways to enable monitor mode such as using</p>



<p>???iwconfig???</p>



<p>but that method does not work for all adapters. This method does not work for all adapters so if you tried enable in monitor mode using the above command and it&#8217;s failed, or if it worked but then the adapter did not behave as expected when using it, then a good idea is to try to enable monitor mode using a different method.</p>



<p>For example if your wireless adapter is in ???Managed mode??? and don???t know how to get it into ???Monitoring mode???, the fix is easy.</p>



<p>The first thing that you can do is disable the interface by typing</p>



<p><a></a>???ifconfig lan0 down???</p>



<p>Now you can go ahead and enable monitor mode, but before doing that it???s good to kill any process that can interfere with using the adapter in monitor mode. To do that we have to use a tool called ???airmon-ng??? Type:</p>



<p>???airmon-ng check kill???</p>



<p>Here we&#8217;re going to tell Kali that we want you to check all the processes that can interfere with monitor mode, and if you find anything, we want you to kill those. Very simple command.</p>



<p>Airmon-ng is in the name of the program. ???Check??? means check any processes that could interfere with in monitor mode. ???Kill??? means to kill the processes if there are any.</p>



<p>If you hit enter, you&#8217;ll see that it will kill a few processes and you&#8217;ll notice that the network manager icon disappears. This is because this command kills it and you will lose your internet connection if you were connected, but that&#8217;s fine because you&#8217;ll lose your internet connection anyway if you enable monitor mode.</p>



<p>By doing this, it makes the adapter work better in monitor mode. Now you are ready to enable monitor mode, and instead of using the command</p>



<p>???iwconfig???</p>



<p>You can use:</p>



<p>???airmon-ng start wlan0???</p>



<p>Once again, airmon-ng is the name of the program that we&#8217;re using to enable monitor mode. ???Start??? means we want to start monitor mode, on an interface called ???wlan0???</p>



<p>Now, if your wlan interface is is not zero, but 1 or 2, you want a place the right number where I reference the zero with the number of your wireless interface. Once you hit enter, you will get a message telling you that monitor mode is enabled on wlan0.</p>



<p>Now if you type</p>



<p>???iwconfig??? you will see that the interface called ???wlan0??? has disappeared. You no longer have an interface called ???wlan0??? and instead, you have a new interface called ???wlan0mon??? but if you look at the mode of this interface,</p>



<p><a></a>you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s in ???monitor??? mode.</p>



<p>After that whenever you want to use a program that requires monitor mode, make sure that you set the interface to ???wlan0mon???.</p>



<p>In case you have tried to enable monitor mode using the command</p>



<p>???iwconfig???</p>



<p>and that didn&#8217;t work and then you tried this method too, and still didn&#8217;t work, then chances are that your adapter does not support monitor mode because not all adapters support monitor mode. Therefore you have to check the chapter on recommended adopters.</p>



<p>Moving on, once your interface is in Monitor mode, you should be capturing traffic over the air. Once you have enough data has been collected, it???s time to display them.</p>



<p>Within Kali Linux, go into Applications, down to Kali Linux Top 10 Security Tools, and there&#8217;s Wireshark. Click on that tab, and brings up the Wireshark application listing your interfaces.</p>



<p>Select your wireless interface, in my case is wlan0mon, and click Start to see the capture data. If you look at the captured packets, you should see that there are a combination of requests to send, clear to send, a beacon frame, and some user data.</p>



<p>Now you can save all these data by clicking on ???Save??? or ???Save As??? and you can take it away and analyze it at a later date. It is that easy to capture information over the air.</p>

<p><strong>Capturing Traffic with Port Mirroring</strong></p>



<p>For all computer connected to the network to process ARP broadcast packet would be a waste of resources. Instead, the network interface cards of the devices on the network for whom the packet is not destined, recognize that the packet is not for them, so the packet is discarded, rather than being passed to the CPU for processing.</p>



<p>By using promiscuous mode, you can ensure that all the traffic is captured. When operating in promiscuous mode, the network interface card passes every packet it sees to the host processor, regardless of the addressing.</p>



<p>Once the packet makes it to the CPU, it can be grabbed by the tool called Wireshark for analysis. There are three primary ways to capture traffic from a target device on a switched network.</p>



<p>The first one is ARP poisoning, or Man-In-The-Middle attack, which I just shared with you in the previous chapter using them both in conjunction.</p>



<p>The second method to capture traffic from a target device on a switched network is by using a tap. Also known as a ???Network Tap??? which is a hardware device that you can place between two end points on your cabling system to capture traffic between them.</p>



<p>The third method is Port Mirroring. Port Mirroring or port spanning, is perhaps the easiest way to capture the traffic from a target device on a switched network.</p>



<p>In this type of setup, you must have access to the command line or web management interface of the switch on which the target computer is located.</p>



<p>Likewise, the network switch must support mirroring and have an unused port in which you can plug in your sniffer. You can set up Port Mirroring on most Cisco switches once you have connected to it, using either ???SSH??? or a console cable.</p>



<p>To enable port mirroring, you issue a command that forces the switch to copy all traffic on one port to another port. But first, you should list the ports on a switch by issuing the command</p>



<p>???show ip interface brief???</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the Cisco switch commands, no worries too much</p>



<p><a></a>as we only going to look at a simple example. Once you have listed the available Ethernet ports, let&#8217;s say that you want to install your sniffer on port 2 and forward all the traffic from port 1 to port 2.</p>



<p>To begin the configuration commands, you first issue the command</p>



<p>???configure terminal???</p>



<p>of just</p>



<p>???conf t???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Next, you need to specify the source port, which is port 1 for our example, so you start your command by typing ???monitor???, followed by a random session number.</p>



<p>The session number could be any number of your choice, and then you specify that it&#8217;s a source; and finally you enter the port number.</p>



<p>Then you type the destination port number, and this is where your sniffer is sitting. Same command with the same session number, but this time it&#8217;s a destination and the port number is 2.</p>



<p>The commands you want to type are as follows:</p>



<p>???conf t???</p>



<p>???monitor session 1 source interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1???</p>



<p>???monitor session 1 destination interface GigabitEthernet 1/0/2???</p>



<p>???exit???</p>



<p>???exit???</p>



<p>???write memory???</p>



<p>To verify your monitoring session, you can type the command ???show session??? followed by the session number, in this case 1 as follows;</p>



<p>???show session 1???</p>



<p>The output will show you that the source port is GigabitEthernet number 1, and the destination port is GigabitEthernet number 2. After these steps, all traffic will be forwarded from port 1 to port 2.</p>

<p><strong>ARP Poisoning with EtterCAP</strong></p>



<p>Imagine that you have been assigned to carry out a MITM (Man in the Middle) attack against a specific host or server, and the choice of tools to use are up to you.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to carry out a MITM attack , and in this chapter we are going to use another excellent tool that you might consider called EtterCAP.</p>



<p>EtterCAP is another great way of going about MITM attack as it has user friendly Graphical User Interface or GUI that provides a so called click, select and go method.</p>



<p>It???s always better to have more knowledge on additional tools if they wouldn???t work or wouldn???t have access at the time of yo uare assigned to do pen testing.</p>



<p>You should be aware that in order to achieve the same result, there are other options that you can go for. EtterCAP is another built in tool on Kali Linux platform. To launch EtterCAP, you can issue a command:</p>



<p>???ettercap ???G???</p>



<p>Then press enter. Once EtterCAP is launched, it will wait for us to provide further instructions, and you should first click on a menu option: Sniff &gt; then choose ???unified sniffing???.</p>



<p>Next, you should specify the network interface that you will use for sniffing. In my case it???s ethernet0.</p>



<p>This will create some additional menu options, so now you should click on the menu option: ???Host???, then click on ???Scan for hosts???.</p>



<p>This should take no longer 5 seconds to discover all hosts that are on the same network. Once complete, go back to the menu icon; Host &gt; then click on host lists in order to see all the hosts IP Addresses and the MAC addresses associated to them.</p>



<p>Once ou have a list of hosts, you can highlight the source address and click on ???<em>Add to target 1???</em>, then highlight the destination address and click on ???<em>Add</em> <em>to target 2???.</em></p>



<p><a></a>The method we use is called ARP POISONING.</p>



<p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Routers, Layer 3 Switches have ARP entries or ARP tables that contains all IP Addresses and their associated Mac Addresses or Physical Addresses that are connected to the network.</p>



<p>Yet, if we use ARP Poisoning, we could fake the real source address by telling the destination that we have the IP Address and the Mac address of the source node, so all traffic that is planned to reach the real source host, from now on, would first come to us.</p>



<p>In addition, all traffic that is planned to reach the destination host would come to us as well, as we would also poison the real source and tell it that the destination IP Address and Mac address is now our machine.</p>



<p>Using ARP Poisoning is one of the best method to create a Man in the Middle attack as now all traffic that is going back and forth between the source and the destination is actully coming through us.</p>



<p>Having all those traffic captured, we can decide if we just want to analyse it, other then capture it, modify it, forward to a different destination, or simple stop the communication between those devices.</p>



<p>Therefore, the final piece to launch such an attack is to click on the menu icon called ???MITM??? and then select ???ARP poisoning???. Once you finished and want to stop ARP Poisoning, click on ???Stop MITM attack(s)???.</p>



<p>Lastly, I will ask you again to make sure that you have written authorization for using this method in a live or production environment, as any type of Man in the Middle attack is very dangerous, especially when you manipulate routed traffic through poisoning the ARP tables by feeding fake Mac addresses.</p>



<p>If you are only practicing in your home lab, in a non production environment, that should cause no issue to anyone; still I would suggest you turn off your router and practice with care without any connection to the internet.</p>
